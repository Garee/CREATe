Y. (2010). Piracy, music, and movies: A natural experiment (No. 2010: 18). Working Paper, Department of Economics, Uppsala University.\n|Abstract=This paper investigates the effects of illegal file sharing (piracy) on music and movie sales. The Swedish implementation of the European Union directive IPRED on April 1, 2009 suddenly increased the risk of being caught and prosecuted for file sharing. We investigate the subsequent drop in piracy as approximated by the drop in Swedish Internet traffic and the effects on music and movie sales in Sweden. We find that the reform decreased Internet traffic by 18 percent during the subsequent six months. It also increased sales of physical music by 27 percent and digital music by 48 percent. Furthermore, it had no significant effects on the sales of theater tickets or DVD movies. The results indicate that pirated music is a strong substitute for legal music whereas the substitutability is less for movies.\n|Authentic Link=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hhsiuiwop/0854.htm\n|Link=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hhsiuiwop/0854.htm\n|Reference=Dee & Evans (2003); Bertrand et al.

More specifically, This article argues that: \n\n*The Swedish implementation of the IPRED law on April 1, 2009 suddenly increased the risks of piracy. Piracy decreased and that music sales increased after the law reform.\n\n*Pirated music is a strong substitute to legal music, whereas the substitutability is less for movies. After six months, piracy recovered to a large extent, which resulted in a decrease in the demand for legal music and decreased physical as well as total sales.\n\n*This raises some doubts regarding the effectiveness of such law reforms in the long run, but it also points towards better legal alternatives to piracy as a possible way forward for the music industry.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2010). Demographic Factors Affecting Freshman Students' Attitudes towards Software Piracy: An Empirical Study. Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology, 7, 321-328.\n|Abstract=The widespread use of computers and the Internet has provided many advantages to everyday life, but also created new opportunities for unethical and illegal acts such as software piracy. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) and International Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that worldwide software piracy rate went up to 41 percent in 2008 and worldwide losses to software vendors due to software piracy totaled more than $50 billion in 2008 (BSA and IDC, 2009). Besides being an economic problem, software piracy is also an ethical issue, especially in academic settings. The evidences from numerous studies suggest that many undergraduate students consider software piracy and other unethical use of information technologies as an acceptable behavior.\n\nThe main purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationships between the demographic characteristics of freshman students and their attitudes towards software piracy. Data were obtained from a survey sample of 125 students in the Department of Business Administration at a public university in Turkey. The study found that overall attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy are close to neutral position on the Likert scale. The results of the regression analysis showed that monthly family income and duration of Internet usage in a week affected attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy, but to a lower extent.\n|Authentic Link=http://iisit.org/Vol7/IISITv7p321-328Acilar817.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1695780\n|Reference=Moores and Chang (2006); Sims et al.

Education is one of the most common recommendations in the literature for preventing software piracy and raising awareness of software piracy among students. Education on ethical topics and information technology use should include ethical use of information technologies and software in the curriculum and should be supported by the real case studies. Giving examples of arrested software pirates in the lectures might create a deeper awareness of the seriousness of the consequences of software piracy. \nA clearly stated information technology usage policy should be adopted by the universities. And, students should be informed about relevant legislation and university policy for use of information technology resources.\n|Description of Data=The data for this study was obtained by surveying a sample of one hundred and sixty freshman students at the Department of Business Administration at a public university in Turkey.

(2013). Digital music consumption on the internet: Evidence from clickstream data. Working Paper No. JRC79605. Available at SSRN 2265299\n|Abstract=The goal of this paper is to analyze the behavior of digital music consumers on the Internet. Using clickstream data on a panel of more than 16,000 European consumers, we estimate the effects of illegal downloading and legal streaming on the legal purchases of digital music. Our results suggest that Internet users do not view illegal downloading as a substitute to legal digital music. Although positive and significant, our estimated elasticities are essentially zero: a 10% increase in clicks on illegal downloading websites leads to a 0.2% increase in clicks on legal purchases websites. Online music streaming services are found to have a somewhat larger (but still small) effect on the purchases of digital sound recordings, suggesting complementarities between these two modes of music consumption. According to our results, a 10% increase in clicks on legal streaming websites lead to up to a 0.7% increase in clicks on legal digital purchases websites. We find important cross country difference in these effects.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2265299\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2265299\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Belleflamme and Peitz (2010); Waldfogel (2010); Hammond (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Illegal music downloads have little or no effect on legal digital sales; although there is trespassing of private property rights (copyrights), there is unlikely to be much harm done on digital music revenues.\n\n* The above assertion must be interpreted in the context of a still evolving music industry. It is important to note that music consumption in physical format has until recently accounted for the lion's share of total music revenues. If piracy leads to substantial sales displacement of music in physical format, then its effect on the overall music industry revenues may well still be negative.\n\n* The effect of online music streaming on the legal purchases of digital music suggests complementarity between streaming services and purchases of legal digital music. However this effect is different across countries: it is larger for France and the UK while it is smaller for Spain and Italy.\n\n* Digital music revenues to record companies are growing substantially, reflecting the increasing importance of digitization in the music industry (IFPI, 2012). From that perspective, the study's findings suggest that digital music piracy should not be viewed as a growing concern for copyright holders in the digital era. In addition, those findings indicate that new music consumption channels such as online streaming positively affect copyrights owners.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

From that perspective, this study’s findings suggest that digital music piracy should not be viewed as a growing concern for copyright holders in the digital era. In addition, results indicate that new music consumption channels such as online streaming positively affect copyrights owners.\n|Description of Data=The study’s sample contains information on 5000 individuals for each of the five largest European economies: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.

Copyright, and the Welfare Effects of Music Trade (December 3, 2014) (2014).\n|Abstract=Since the launch of the iTunes Music Store in the US in 2003 and in much of Europe in the following years, music trade has shifted rapidly from physical to digital products, raising the availability of products in different countries. Despite substantial growth in availability, choice sets have not converged across countries; and observers point to copyright-related transaction costs as an obstacle to greater availability. Policy makers are now contemplating various copyright reforms that could reduce these trade costs. The possibility of these changes raises the question of how much benefit they would create for consumers and producers around the world. We address these questions with a structural model of supply and demand for music in 17 countries, which we employ to counterfactually simulate the effect of a European digital single market (the equivalent of a pan-European copyright regime) on the welfare of consumers and producers. We also simulate autarky and worldwide frictionless trade - in which all products are available in all countries - allowing us to quantify both the conventional gains from status quo trade as well as the maximum possible gains available to free trade. Existing and additional trade have different patterns of benefit to consumers and producers. Status quo trade benefits consumers everywhere, but European consumers have benefited more than North Americans. Existing trade has had large benefits to American producers but on balance small benefits to European producers. Additional trade would continue the pattern of consumers benefits with larger gains to European consumers but would reverse the pattern for producers. Greater availability of products resulting from easing of copyright restrictions would raise per capita gains to producers in Europe more than in North America. Finally, we find that a European single market would bring most of the benefits of worldwide frictionless trade to both consumers and producers alike.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2603238\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2603238\n|Reference=Buccafusco and Heald (2012); Gomez Herrera and Martens (2014); Ferreira and Waldfogel (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Moving from the current status quo to an EU Digital Single Market for music would increase consumer surplus from digital music consumption by 1.8 per cent (€19 million) and music producers' revenue by 1.1 per cent (€10 million). Benefits vary considerably across Member States. Under worldwide frictionless trade consumers in 15 European countries gain €31 million (a 3% increase) while North American consumers gain €6.5 million (a 0.35% increase). Most of the gains from fully frictionless trade - about two thirds - are accomplished by a European single market. Annual gains from worldwide frictionless trade for producers, compared to autarky, reach 1.9% in Europe and 0.38% in the US. Clearly, the additional gains from moving beyond a European Digital Single Market to a worldwide open market would be small for European producers and consumers. Digital music production and consumption is only a small part of all media markets covered by copyright. We note that the figures presented here represent only a fraction of the potential benefits from further trade opening in other digital media.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Investigating software piracy in Jordan: An extension of the theory of reasoned action. Journal of Business Ethics, 98(4), 663-676.\n|Abstract=Software piracy, the illegal and unauthorized duplication, sale, or distribution of software, is a widespread and costly phenomenon. According to Business Software Alliance (2008), over 41% of the PC software packages installed worldwide were unauthorized copies. Software piracy behavior has been investigated for more than 30 years. However, after a review of the relevant literature, there appears to be two voids in this literature: a lack of studies in non-Western countries and a scarcity of process studies. This study contributes to literature by developing a software piracy model to better understand the decision-making process that underlies this unethical behavior. The model was tested using data collected from a sample of 323 undergraduate business students. Consistent with the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), attitudes toward software piracy and subjective norms were significant predictors of intention to pirate software. Also, the results suggested that ethical ideology, public self-consciousness, and low self-control moderated the effect of these variables on intention to pirate software. The results have important practical implications for the software industry and governments hoping to curtail software piracy. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future studies are discussed as well.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-010-0645-4#page-1\n|Reference=Logsdon et al.

(2006); Gan and Koh (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Because human behaviour is widely believed to be determined by both social influences and dispositional (attitude) factors, the study uses and extends the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to develop a process that links social influence, attitude and intention to pirate software to analyse the determinants of software piracy in Jordan. TRA posits that the most immediate precursor of behaviour is an individual’s intention to behave, which in turn is determined by attitude toward a target behaviour and subjective norms. Subjective norms are perceived social pressures exerted on an individual to perform a behaviour or not. The results of the study were as follows:\n\n* TRA was a useful theoretical framework to predict Jordanian university students’ intentions to engage in software piracy and explained variance in the individual’s intention to pirate software;\n\n* Relative to attitude, subjective norms had a stronger effect on intention to pirate software;\n\n* The influence of perceived subjective norms on intention to pirate software was about twice as great as that of attitude toward software piracy;\n\n* The stronger effect of subjective norms in shaping Jordanian university students intention to pirate software relative to their attitudes might be attributed to the collectivistic nature of the Jordan culture;\n\n* The effect of students’ attitude on their intention to pirate software was significantly moderated by ethical ideology (idealism and relativism);\n\n* The presence of low self-control enhanced the effect of subjective norms on behavioral intention. This suggests that low self-control students had stronger intentions to pirate software when they perceived that significant others were supportive of or engaged in such behaviour and vice versa;\n\n* High public self- consciousness students were more attuned to significant others’ demands and opinions than students with low public self-consciousness; thus, their intentions to pirate software were determined more by their perception of subjective norms;\n\n* Religiosity had insignificant moderating effect on the software piracy attitude– intention relationship;\n\n* Subjective norms did not affect all students equally; subjective norms had a stronger effect on students who scored higher on low self-control and public self-consciousness scales;\n\n* The effect of attitude on intention to pirate software was significantly moderated by ethical ideology.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

On a theoretical basis, the study adds to existing software piracy literature/policy by developing a behavioural process model and testing it in a developing country with higher piracy rates.  On a practical basis, the study implicates university policy as regards software piracy so as to suggest the following:\n\n* Students should be exposed to new information to increase the probability of increasing new norms that would replace existing norms. Through media, workshops or group discussion, students should be shown that software piracy norms among students are exaggerated;\n\n* An intervention program might indicate that there are a substantial portion of significant others who disapprove of software piracy behaviour;\n\n* The intervention program might reveal the identities of software pirates to the public through the media and the campus newspaper;\n\n* Presenting students with new information that associates software piracy with negative consequences such as lost taxes, higher software prices, and lost jobs should lead to these individuals forming new beliefs and developing a negative attitude toward software piracy.\n|Description of Data=The study uses questionnaire data collected from a sample of undergraduate business students at Yarmouk University, Jordan. 400 questionnaires were distributed with 330 completed and returned. 323 questionnaires were analysable and this represented about an 80% response rate.

The results show, that while the overall model was significant in predicting the piracy behavior across the two cultures, there were differences in the influence of the individual variables. Subjective norm was only significant in the Middle East, and moral obligation was highly significant in the U.S. sample (while being of low significance in the Middle Eastern sample).

This can be justified using Hofstede's (2010) individualism cultural dimension, since the US is a highly individualistic society (resulting in non-significant SN factor), while the ME culture is highly collectivistic (resulting in a significant SN factor;\n\nOverall, the US sample pirated more than the ME sample.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Lost revenues due to digital piracy could reach $5 billion by the end of 2005. Preventives and deterrents do not seem to be working – losses are increasing. This study examines factors that influence an individual’s attitude toward pirating digital material. The results of this study suggest that attitude toward digital pirating is influenced by beliefs about the outcome of behavior (cognitive beliefs), happiness and excitement(affective beliefs), age, the perceived importance of the issue, the influence of significant others (subjective norms), and machiavellianism. Given these results, measures can be developed which could alter attitudes toward digital piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25123707?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n|Reference=Bass and Bernett (1999); Conner and Armitage (1998); Jones and Kavanagh (1996); Leonard and Cronan (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The authors tested hypothesis whether Individual attitudes toward digital pirating is influenced by beliefs about the outcome of the behaviour.

So if people scored high on the machiavellianism scale they were more likely to view piracy more positively. Same with people who had more positive beleifs about piracy (cognitive beleifs)\n\n* Subjective norms, happiness/excitement, importance, and age were all significant in explainging differences in attitudes toward piracy. The younger and more happy/excited individuals had a more positive outlook on piracy. The attitudes of important people was also significant in explaining attitudes toward piracy, so if important people viewed piracy in a more acceptable light the person him/herself was more likely to view it favorably as well.

The study used an experiment where different treatments (effect of religion, law, and awareness) were applied to the samples. Results revealed that only the religion and awareness treatments contributed to a decline in digital piracy, and that awareness having the higher effect on the piracy intention. This study discusses the study results and implications for both research and practice.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585309000823\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222405810_The_fight_against_digital_piracy_An_experiment\n|Reference=Ajzen (2001); Armitage and Conner (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The authors tested three hypothesis; whether piracy laws, religious beleifs and awarenes or reprocussons of piracy affected the subjects intention to digitally pirate.\n\n* The authors findings seem to suggest that piracy is illegal seem not to matter when people make a decision on whether to pirate or not. The subjects were educated about the new laws fighting digital piracy but it didn't have a significant affect in decreasing the intent to digitally pirate.\n\n* The authors also tried a religious treatment where they were told that the Islamic scholars denounced digital piracy. This was found to have a significant affect in decreasing the intent to pirate.\n\n* The largest significant effect was found in the awareness treatment where subjects were made aware of the negative impact of digital piracy and the future ramifications of it. When subjects were made aware of the negative impacrs of digital piracy their intention to pirate dropped (in a statistically significant fashion) the most compared to the other treatments. This suggests that making people more aware of the negative impacts of digital piracy is the most effective policy for decreasing the intent to digitally pirate, out of the three treatment groups.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Available at SSRN 1469412.\n|Abstract=Copyright incentives and rewards to producers of works have been able to exist alongside other values, such as freedom of expression. However, changes in the way information products are being disseminated raises questions as to whether those values remain compatible with the new modes of dissemination.  So far, studies devoted to digital rights management (DRM) and copyright exceptions have noted, theoretically, its legal implications.  This research filled an existing gap by unveiling, through empirical lines of enquiry, (1) whether certain acts which are permitted by law are being adversely affected by the use of DRM and (2) whether technology can accommodate conflicts between freedom of expression and DRM - linking, thus, policy conclusions to empirical findings.\nThe survey concluded that some beneficiaries of privileged exceptions are being adversely affected by the use of DRM and practical solutions are required.  Thus, it is proposed that, in the short term, with the help of the empirical findings and recommendations of this study, the EC Commission submits a proposal for two amendment of Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive, as follows:\n(1) A definition of the expression ‘appropriate measures’ should be inserted in Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive, stating that for the purposes of that Directive such measures require the establishment of a procedure to enable expeditious access to works by beneficiaries of privileged exceptions, leading to the creation of standardized access to works portals across EC Member States.\nThe existence of access to works portals would be made possible by a DRM deposit system, according to which the means to enable beneficiaries of privileged exceptions to benefit from them would be deposited and made available through access to works portals, in specified circumstances.\n(2) It should be added to Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive that where access to works by beneficiaries of privileged exceptions is not facilitated, the protection of privileged exceptions (given their connection to core freedoms) prevails over the protection of DRM, even where works are supplied online on agreed contractual terms.\n|Authentic Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.9017&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1469412\n|Reference=Garnett (2006); Guibault et al (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study, by questionnaires and interviews, found some organisations and individuals who are beneficiaries of  privileged exceptions are adversely affected by DRM.

What students reveal through an ethical dilemma. Ethics and Information Technology, 11(1), 49-56.\n|Abstract=Although downloading music through unapproved channels is illegal, statistics indicate that it is widespread. The following study examines the attitudes and perceptions of college students that are potentially engaged in music downloading. The methodology includes a content analysis of the recommendations written to answer an ethical vignette. The vignette presented the case of a subject who faces the dilemma of whether or not to download music illegally. Analyses of the final reports indicate that there is a vast and inconsistent array of actions and underlying feelings toward digital music downloading. The findings reveal inconsistencies between participants’ recommendations (what the subject should do) and their attitudes and opinions on the matter (what they would do in a similar situation). These inconsistencies support the notion that as technology evolves, it creates discrepancies between the way things are and the way the law expects them to be, leaving society in a muddle, trying to reconcile the two. What remains to be seen is whether the discrepancy in the case of music downloading becomes extreme enough that the law changes to accommodate an increasingly prevalent behavior, or whether new business models will emerge to bridge the gap between legality and reality.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-008-9179-1\n|Reference=Benbunan-Fich (1998); Siegfried (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The following study is an investigation into what is occurring in society’s collective mind as it continues to download digital music.

However, the results did indicate that attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control each accounted for significant variance in P2P file downloading behaviour, and that these relationships were fully mediated by behavioural intent. These findings are consistent with, and provide strong support for, the use of the TPB within this domain.\n|Link=http://www.igi-global.com/article/peer-peer-file-sharing/48523\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2151, 'title': 'All Studies', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "'''{{#ask: [[Category:Studies]]| format=count}}''' studies are currently recorded.\n\n{{#ask:[[Category:Studies]]\n|?Has full citation=Citation\n|?Last editor is=Last Editor\n|?Modification date=Modified\n|?Creation date=Created\n|format=table\n|limit=500\n|offset=0\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2715, 'title': 'Amedeo Piolatto and Florian Schuett', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

The paper breaks with the mainstream economics approach which dominates the music file-sharing discussion. Whereas such models assume relationships at the micro level (e.g. between file-sharing and purchases) based on observations made at the macro level, our evolutionary economics approach measures the direct effects using micro data representative of the Canadian population. The behavioral incentives underpinning free music downloading, novel to this paper, are the multiple effects of: ‘unwillingness to pay’ (market substitution), ‘hear before buying’ (market creation), ‘not wanting to buy a whole album’ (market segmentation), and ‘not available in the CD format or on electronic pay-sites’ (market creation). Although the two first mentioned incentives significantly influence CD album purchases—i.e. there is a negative and significant market substitution effect and a positive and significant market creation effect—on the whole, these two effects ‘cancel’ one another out, leading to no association between the number of P2P files downloaded and CD album sales.\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225722824_Dont_blame_the_P2P_file-sharers_the_impact_of_free_music_downloads_on_the_purchase_of_music_CDs_in_Canada\n|Reference=Andersen and Frenz (2007); Liebowitz (2008); Rob and Waldfogel (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Tested 3 hypothesis:\n# There is a negative relationship between the perceived price of CD albums and number of CD albums bought.\n# There is a negative relationship between ‘free music downloads and P2P file-sharing’ and CD sale.

Market creation is when people want to test out the product before buying it.\n\n* The authors also found a negative CD market substitution effect. Where P2P activity was motivated because CD albums were perceived as being too expensive, such downloads displaced CD sales.\n\n* A strong taste for music, measured as the selfassessed interest in music, is positively related to music purchasing\n\n* The positive sampling or market creation effect and the negative sampling effect cancel one another out.\n\n* The authors also conclude that music purchasing in general takes up too low a share of peoples’ income to have any effect on purchasing behavior\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

First, the findings imply that improving economic development may play an important role in lowering rates of piracy.Second, it appears that, whereas some piracy is inevitable during the early stage of development, the rate of piracy may be minimized at a later stage through the incentives provided by the development itself. Third, the results indicate that policies aimed at guaranteeing legal provision of the tools necessary to protect software would certainly contribute to curbing the software piracy problem.\n|Description of Data=Data on the variables used in the empirical analysis come from diverse sources.

The impact of music downloads and P2P file-sharing on the purchase of music in Canada.\n|Abstract=This paper addresses the emergence and growth of new types of markets, - the on-line markets for electronic delivered music -, which in turn influence organizational change and industry evolution in the music industry. (The direct challenge this raises for the copyright and the appropriability regime in the music industry is also central to the results.) The direct focus on the paper is consumption and consumer behaviour in music markets. This study measures the extent to which free music downloads and peer-to-peer file sharing networks, for which the sound recording industry receives no remuneration, affect music purchasing activity in Canada, including both electronic delivered music and CDs. The big debate is whether free music downloading and copying substitute existing music pay-markets or reinforce them. The analysis relies on representative micro-data of the Canadian population age 15 and over, obtained by asking Canadian individuals to what extent they are engaged in downloading and/or purchasing of music, and about their incentives behind such behaviours, focusing on the conventional mainstream demand-side factors related to (i) price of the good, (ii) price of related goods (whether substitutes or complements), (iii) consumer income, and (iv) consumer taste.\nThis paper builds upon a major study conducted for Industry Canada between 2005-08, and was aimed at supporting policy decisions in relation to the internal review of the copyright regime in Canada.\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/10508/\n|Link=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/10508/\n|Reference=Begg, Fischer and Dornbusch (1994); Liebowitz (2004); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004); Liebowitz (2005); Andersen, Kozul-Wright and Kozul-Wright (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This paper addresses the emergence and growth of new types of markets – the on-line markets for electronic delivered music – which in turn influence organizational change and industry evolution in the music industry. The direct challenge this raises for the copyright and the appropriability regime in the music industry is also central to the results. The direct focus on the paper is consumption and consumer behaviour in music markets. This study measures the extent to which free music downloads and peer-to-peer file sharing networks, for which the sound recording industry receives no remuneration, affect music purchasing activity in Canada, including both electronic delivered music and CDs. The big debate is whether free music downloading and copying substitute existing music pay-markets or reinforce them. More specifically, this paper shows that: \n\n* Those engaging in free music downloads and file-sharing do not purchase more or less music compared with those who are not engaged in such activities, but that very active downloaders and file-sharers purchase more music compared with downloaders and file-sharers who download relatively few songs.\n\n* There is a positive and statistically significant relationship between the number of music tracks downloaded via P2P networks and the number of CDs purchased.\n\n* Both the P2P file-sharing group and the entire population show a positive and statistically significant association between ripping CDs and CD purchases.\n\n* Canadians who participate in P2P file-sharing because they find CD albums to be too expensive also purchase fewer CDs.\n\n* People who participate in P2P file-sharing because the music is ‘not available elsewhere’ also tend to purchase more CDs.\n\n* There is no direct evidence that CD price influences CD purchases.\n\n* Respondents who experienced a higher CD price purchased fewer electronically-delivered music tracks.\n\n* People who buy a high number of DVDs, videogames, cinema tickets and concert tickets also purchase a high number of CD albums.\n\n* Music purchasing in general takes up a too low share of peoples’ income to have any effect on purchasing behaviour.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

These exceptions are sections 47J and 110AA of the Copyright Act 1968 which permit photographs and cinematograph films to be reproduced in a different format for private use, subject to certain conditions.  The review included a call for interested party submissions and intergovernmental agency consultations.\nCopyright is a form of intellectual property that protects the rights of creators in certain original forms of expression, including photographs and cinematograph films. It rewards creative effort, and economic investment in creative effort, by granting a number of exclusive economic rights. These rights provide an incentive to encourage the generation and flow of new material to the public. One of the core rights granted by copyright is the right to prevent other persons from copying a work. While copyright does not guarantee a proportionate return for the work involved, the ability to require other persons to pay for copying can give creators and investors some security for the skill, time and resources necessary to produce new works.\nThe Act also provides many exceptions which limit the scope of copyright. These exceptions are an integral part of copyright, recognising that in some circumstances the usual rights of copyright owners should not apply. Exceptions may be adopted for various reasons; such as to permit incidental uses that do not cause significant harm to copyright owners or because a particular limitation of copyright serves the broader public interest. The nature and scope of exceptions reflect decisions by Parliament on balancing public and private interests.\n|Authentic Link=http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/copyrightexceptionsforprivatecopyingofphotographsandfilmsreviewofsections47jand110aaofthecopyrightact1968.pdf\n|Link=http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/copyrightexceptionsforprivatecopyingofphotographsandfilmsreviewofsections47jand110aaofthecopyrightact1968.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Recommendation 1: The Department recommends a re-examination of public awareness material and consumer information on the meaning of the format-shifting exceptions to assist people to understand their rights and obligations under the Copyright Act 1968.\n\n* Recommendation 2: The Department recommends that no change be made to section 47J at this time. However it would be beneficial to provide further public information in relation to copyright in photographs taken professionally for a family or private occasion.\n\n* Recommendation 3: The Department recommends that no change be made to section 110AA at this time.

Asser Instituut/Asser International Sports Law Centre and the Institute for Information Law - University of Amsterdam (2014) Study on Sports Organisers' Rights in the European Union, EAC/18/2012\n|Abstract=The legal protection of rights to sporting events (”sports organisers' rights”) is a contentious issue. While in recent years distinct aspects of the problem have been addressed by legislatures and courts, both at the national and at the European level, a great deal of legal uncertainty persists. Divergent views on the appropriateness, form and scope of such legal protection exist among stakeholders and other concerned parties, reflecting the complex nature and multiple functions of sports in modern society. The universe of sports and media is a complex network of social and commercial relationships with a variety of stakeholders, each one of whom can claim rights or specific interests in the value chain of organizing and exploiting sports events, such as clubs, leagues, athletes, federations, fans, media content providers, sponsors, owners of sport facilities, sports betting operators and news media.  \n\nConsequently, the question of protecting sports events is by no means a one-dimensional legal issue, and should be framed in a broader socio-economic context. On the one hand, professional sport represents a large and fast-growing sector of the European economy – and in no small measure this is due to the commercial significance of sports media rights. On the other hand, sports are widely regarded as playing a pivotal role as a “social cohesive”, an agent of communal, and conveyor of moral, values. This helps explain why major sports events qualify in various Member States as “events of major importance” for society, subject to special media rules mitigating exclusive rights of broadcasters to guarantee viewers’ access to these events via free-to-air television.  \n\nThe general objective of this study is to examine and critically assess a number of the most pressing questions of substantive law relating to the existence and exercise of sports organisers' rights in the EU. The specific objectives of the study are:  \n\uf0b7 To map the legal framework applicable to the origin and ownership of sports organisers' rights in the 28 Member States; \uf0b7 To analyse the nature and scope of sports organisers' rights with regard to licensing practices in the field of the media, taking into account relevant EU law provisions; \uf0b7 To examine the possibility of establishing licensing practices beyond the media field, notably in the area of gambling and betting; \uf0b7 To provide recommendations on the opportunity of EU action to address any problem that may be identified in the above mentioned areas of analysis.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2014/docs/study-sor2014-final-report-gc-compatible_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2014/docs/study-sor2014-final-report-gc-compatible_en.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The rights and interests of sports organisers are generally well safeguarded at the substantive legal level. The “house right” gives sports events organisers and clubs (and indirectly the sports federations) a right to exclude unauthorized media from the venue, and thereby creates leverage for the event organisers to negotiate exclusive contracts regarding media coverage. In practice, these contracts may or may not provide for complete or partial transfer(s) to the sports organisers of the copyrights and neighbouring rights in the audiovisual recording and transmission of the event. Sports events organisers or their federations may, alternatively, elect to produce and distribute media coverage of the sports events themselves. Either way, the combination of house right, media contract(s), and intellectual property protection of the audiovisual recording and broadcast effectively allows the sports event organisers to enjoy complete ownership and/or control over the audiovisual rights in the sports events.   \n\n* The integrity and financial benefits of a right to consent to bets can only be fully achieved when it is carefully managed by a national regulatory authority that:  \n1. actively prosecutes illegal betting services (including the offering of sports bets by licensed operators without the sports organisers’ consent); 2. monitors the commercial exploitation of the right to consent to bets to prevent discriminatory or anti-competitive marketing conditions; 3. provides for an ex post mechanism for complaint handling and dispute resolution; 4. has the power to conduct on-going monitoring of the parties’ compliance with the mutual rights and obligations contained in the contractual agreements. \n\n* The right of short news reporting is an important element of the EU legal order safeguarding the right of broadcasters to have access to “events of high interest to the public”, such as important sports events, which are subject to exclusive broadcasting rights. However, the way this right is currently framed, allowing Member States the option of either mandating access to the transmitting broadcaster’s signals, or requiring direct access to the venue where the event takes place, has resulted in some differences in implementation by the Member States (i.e. on the duration of the short news reporting).   \n\n* The comparative analysis of EU and national decisional practice reveals that for the most part the NCAs have replicated the heavy-handed remedy package designed by the European Commission. The “no single buyer” obligation, a remedy that was exceptionally imposed by the Commission in FAPL, is increasingly being emulated at the national level. Only with regard to the duration of exclusivity, more and more NCAs are demonstrating a readiness for a more flexible approach (i.e. by accepting exclusive rights contracts exceeding three years).\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Fair remuneration (levies; copyright contracts),\n|Discipline=L82: Entertainment • Media, L83: Sports • Gambling • Restaurants • Recreation • Tourism, L88: Government Policy, O34: Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital\n|Intervention-Response=The EU should encourage Member States to address the generally observed lack of legal certainty as regards sports sponsorship by gambling operators in the context of their national gambling advertising regulations.  It is recommended that sponsorship-related issues are included in the European Commission’s upcoming “Recommendation on responsible gambling advertising”. Other additional courses of action ought to be considered, in particular to facilitate enforcement co-operation between different national regulatory authorities concerning cross-border advertising of unauthorized gambling services.  \n\nRegarding cross-border sports events, further attention should be paid to the use of technological tools that may offer pragmatic solutions (e.g. virtual advertising). In any event, organisers of such events must respect national legislations. In case they induce participants in their events to infringe national gambling advertising and/or breach personal sponsorship contracts, they should arguably be found liable and not the participant that is faced with a dilemma: respect the regulations of the sports organiser (that typically require participants to comply with the organisers’ sponsorship arrangements) or respect national regulations and personal sponsorship contracts with the risk of being eliminated from the competition.\n|Description of Data=This study combines traditional legal research methods (desk research, literature review, document analysis), with an approach based on “field work” and data collection (qualitative analysis). A three-part questionnaire was drafted, mirroring the three core research questions that the study covers. The first part of the questionnaire concerned the existence, nature, and scope of sports organisers’ rights. The second part focused on the licensing practices related to media rights and image rights. The third was dedicated to the potential for licensing exploitation rights to gambling operators.  The questionnaire was administered to 28 national legal experts (lawyers and legal scholars), carefully selected on the basis of their expertise, from the long-established lists of national correspondents collaborating with the research partners.  Experts' workshops were also held.\n|Data Year=2012-2013\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Case law;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences), Case Study, Document Research\n|Method of Analysis=Meta-Analysis, Textual Content Analysis, Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data), Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Programming and broadcasting; Television programmes;\n|Country=European Union; Australia;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=Yes\n|Funded By=European Commission;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=28\n|Level of Aggregation=Legal experts,\n|Data Material Year=2012-2013\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2662, 'title': 'Asia Pulse, 19 December 2000', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': ''}], 'ns': 0}]}

(2015). Documentarians, fair use, and free expression: changes in copyright attitudes and actions with access to best practices. Information, Communication & Society, (ahead-of-print), 1-10.\n|Abstract=This study, based on a survey of 489 documentary filmmakers, is a case study in copyright policy in and through practice. It assesses the changes in documentary production practice around clearance of copyrighted material since the creation of the Documentary Filmmakers’ Statement of Best Practices in fair use in 2005. Fair use, an exotic and occasional feature of documentary film in 2004, has become well-known and commonly employed. Creative options for filmmakers concerning use of third-party material have dramatically improved with changes in norms after the issuing of the Statement. Attitudes about fair use are strongly associated with free expression and creative opportunity, and vary with experience. Where filmmakers have changed work because of copyright concerns, they themselves rather than any gatekeeper have made the decision to do so. Where change is associated with fair use, risk is a common concern. Newer filmmakers are more likely to support use of copyrighted material to make new work, but less likely to know about fair use, and also more likely to have experienced takedowns online. Both education about and experience with fair use appear to have an effect on practice. Filmmakers continue to lack reliable information on the actual risk landscape, and about fair use on digital platforms.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2603400\n|Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2603400\n|Reference=Abdenour (2014); Aufderheide and Jaszi (2011); Falzone and Urban (2010); Lessig (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study: \n\n*In terms of documentary film-making, increased awareness of group expectations has changed the way that copyright law is used, and thus the utility of the law, and clarity regarding best practices has increased institutional support for creators. \n\n*The use of the Best Practices statement and related activities has transformed employment of fair use into common industry practice.\n\n*Documentary filmmakers’ understanding of and employment of fair use shows a remarkable shift from 2004, when a qualitative study showed widespread uncertainty and when fair use claims were a rare exception rather than a routine feature of filmmaking.\n\n*Today’s filmmakers overwhelmingly perceive fair use as an aid to free expression, and furthermore an aid to expression that does not harm their own ability to use copyright monopoly rights. \n\n*They routinely expect to accompany fair use with credit to third-party creators, which they view as a primary ethical obligation. \n\n*Their knowledge of and confidence in fair use is broader even than their familiarity with the Documentary Filmmakers’ Statement of Fair Use, which suggests that the professional values articulated in the document have been widely internalized in industry practice.\n\n*Many filmmakers have paid for and requested permission to use work when they did not believe they should have to, under fair use, and most of them have changed final product because of copyright concerns. \n\n*Concerns about legal and economic risk appear to be the chief reason filmmakers overlook their own fair use rights, and have come more from the filmmakers themselves than from their gatekeepers. \n\n*These concerns appear to be associated not with any confusion about the legitimacy of their fair use decisions but a lack of awareness of the widespread acceptance of fair use among peers, collaborators and gatekeepers.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

The Report makes a number of recommendations, the overall effect of which will be a more flexible and adaptive copyright framework. The reforms will enhance access to cultural material, without undermining incentives to create. The recommended exceptions are also intended to be more consistent with public standards of fairness.\nThe Terms of Reference for this Inquiry focus on exceptions to copyright law. Exceptions allow certain uses of copyright material that would otherwise be infringements of copyright. Stakeholder input has been highly relevant in identifying the focus of investigation for this Inquiry, and not all exceptions have received consideration. The recommendations in this Report are intended to make the Copyright Act more accessible and better suited to the digital environment, but do not attempt overall redrafting or simplification of the legislation.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/final_report_alrc_122_2nd_december_2013_.pdf\n|Link=http://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/final_report_alrc_122_2nd_december_2013_.pdf\n|Reference=Hargreaves (2012); Copyright Law Review Committee (2000);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The introduction of fair use will mean Australian copyright law can be applied to new technologies and new commercial and consumer practices, without constant recourse to legislative change. Fair use will promote innovation and enable a market-based response to the demands of the digital age.\n\nThe ALRC considers that exceptions to copyright, whether in the form of a specific rule or a general standard, should only permit the unlicensed use of copyright material where this would be fair. It should therefore not be surprising that fair use and each of its illustrative purposes, and the handful of specific exceptions recommended in this Report, have much in common. Generally, they permit the unlicensed use of copyright material if this would:\n• serve an important public purpose;\n• stimulate the creation of new works and the use of existing works for new purposes; and\n• not harm rights holders’ markets—ensuring exceptions do not undermine the crucial incentive to create and publish copyright material.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Importantly, unlike fair use, this exception can only apply to a use of copyright material for one of the prescribed purposes. The purposes are not illustrative.\n\nStatutory Licences\n*Recommendation 8–1 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material which, because of another provision of the Act, would not infringe copyright. This means that governments, educational institutions and institutions assisting people with disability, will be able to rely on unremunerated exceptions, including fair use or the new fair dealing exception, to the extent that they apply.\n*Recommendation 8–2 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material where a government, educational institution, or an institution assisting people with disability, instead relies on an alternative licence, whether obtained directly from rights holders or from a collecting society.\n*Recommendation 8–3 The Copyright Act should be amended to remove any requirement that, to rely on the statutory licence in pt VII div 2, governments must notify or pay equitable remuneration to a declared collecting society. Governments should have the option to notify and pay equitable remuneration directly to rights holders, where this is possible.\n*Recommendation 8–4 The statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 of the Copyright Act should be made less prescriptive. Detailed provisions concerning the setting of equitable remuneration, remuneration notices, records notices, sampling notices, and record keeping should be removed. The Act should not require sampling surveys to be conducted. Instead, the Act should simply provide that the amount of equitable remuneration and other terms of the licences should be agreed between the relevant parties, or failing agreement, determined by the Copyright Tribunal.\n\nQuotation\n*Recommendation 9–1 The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a quotation infringes copyright.\n\nPrivate Use and Social Use\n*Recommendation 10–1 The exceptions for format shifting and time shifting in ss 47J, 109A, 110AA and 111 of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a private use infringes copyright.\n\nIncidental or Technical Use and Data and Text Mining\n*Recommendation 11–1 The exceptions for temporary uses and proxy web caching in ss 43A, 111A, 43B, 111B and 200AAA of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether incidental or technical uses infringes copyright.\n\nLibraries and Archives\n*Recommendation 12–1 Section 200AB of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether uses by libraries and archives infringes copyright.\n*Recommendation 12–2 The exceptions for preservation copying in ss 51A, 51B, 110B, 110BA and 112AA of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception that permits libraries and archives to use copyright material for preservation purposes. The exception should not limit the number or format of copies that may be made.\n\nOrphan Works\n*Recommendation 13–1 The Copyright Act should be amended to limit the remedies available in an action for infringement of copyright, where it is established that, at the time of the infringement:\n(a) a reasonably diligent search for the rights holder had been conducted and the rights holder had not been found; and\n(b) as far as reasonably possible, the user of the work has clearly attributed it to the author.\n*Recommendation 13–2 The Copyright Act should provide that, in determining whether a reasonably diligent search was conducted, regard may be had to, among other things:\n(a) the nature of the copyright material;\n(b) how and by whom the search was conducted;\n(c) the search technologies, databases and registers available at the time; and\n(d) any guidelines, protocols or industry practices about conducting diligent searches available at the time.\n\nEducation\n*Recommendation 14–1 The exceptions for educational use in ss 28, 44, 200, 200AAA and 200AB of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether an educational use infringes copyright.\n\nGovernment Use\n*Recommendation 15–1 The parliamentary libraries exceptions in ss 48A, 50(1)(aa) and 104 of the Copyright Act should be extended to apply to all types of copyright material and all exclusive rights.\n*Recommendation 15–2 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for the purpose of the proceedings of a tribunal, or for reporting those proceedings.\n*Recommendations 17\n*Recommendation 15–3 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for the purpose of the proceedings of a royal commission or a statutory inquiry, or for reporting those proceedings.\n*Recommendation 15–4 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for uses where statutes require local, state or Commonwealth governments to provide public access to copyright material.\n*Recommendation 15–5 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for use of correspondence and other material sent to government. This exception should not extend to uses that make previously published material publicly available.\n\nAccess for People with Disability\n*Recommendation 16–1 The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a use for access for people with disability infringes copyright.\n\nRetransmission of Free-to-air Broadcasts\n*Recommendation 18–1 In developing media and communications policy, and in responding to media convergence, the Australian Government should consider whether the retransmission scheme for free-to-air broadcasts provided by pt VC of the Copyright Act and s 212(2) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) should be repealed.\nNote: This would effectively leave the extent to which retransmission occurs entirely to negotiation between the parties—broadcasters, retransmitters and underlying copyright holders.\nRecommendation 18–2 If the retransmission scheme is retained, the scope and application of the internet exclusion in s 135ZZJA of the Copyright Act should be clarified.\n\nBroadcasting\n*Recommendation 19–1 In developing media and communications policy, and in responding to media convergence, the Australian Government should consider whether the following exceptions in the Copyright Act should be repealed:\n(a) s 45—broadcast of extracts of works;\n(b) ss 47, 70 and 107—reproduction for broadcasting;\n(c) s 109—broadcasting of sound recordings;\n(d) ss 65 and 67—incidental broadcast of artistic works; and\n(e) s 199—reception of broadcasts.\n*Recommendation 19–2 The Australian Government should also consider whether the following exceptions should be amended to extend to the transmission of linear television or radio programs using the internet or other forms of communication to the public:\n(a) s 47A—sound broadcasting by holders of a print disability radio licence; and\n(b) pt VA—copying of broadcasts by educational institutions.\n\nContracting Out\n*Recommendation 20–1 The Copyright Act should provide that any term of an agreement that restricts or prevents the doing of an act, which would otherwise be permitted by specific libraries and archives exceptions, is unenforceable.\n*Recommendation 20–2 The Copyright Act should not provide statutory limitations on contracting out of the fair use exception. However, if fair use is not enacted, limitations on contracting out should apply to the new fair dealing exception.\n|Description of Data=This Inquiry the ALRC consulted with relevant stakeholders, including the community and industry, and engaged in widespread public consultation.\n\nThe first stage of the Inquiry included the release of the Issues Paper in August 2012, to identify the issues raised by the Terms of Reference and suggest principles which could guide proposals for reform, as well as to inform the community about the range of issues under consideration, and invite feedback in the form of submissions. The Issues Paper generated 295 submissions.\n\nOn 30 May 2013 a Discussion Paper was released, and the ALRC again called for submissions to inform the final stage of deliberations leading up to this Report. In total, the ALRC received 870 public and 139 confidential submissions to the Inquiry.\n\nThe ALRC also undertook 109 consultations. Key stakeholders were invited, and took the opportunity, to advise on the composition of industry roundtable meetings. In addition, industry-specific roundtable meetings, consultations and visits were conducted on numerous occasions.\n\nConsultations and submissions included those with and from:\n• academics (individuals and groups);\n• creators and organisations (authors, directors, photographers and others);\n• the education sector;\n• the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) sector;\n• government authorities, (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; the Australian Communications and Media Authority; IP Australia; Standards Australia and many others);\n• media and broadcasting and related organisations and industry bodies;\n• music organisations;\n• online service providers;\n• publishers and publisher organisations; and\n• rights management organisations.\nIn addition to the contribution of expertise by way of consultations and submissions, specific expertise is also obtained in ALRC inquiries through the establishment of its Advisory Committees and the appointment of part-time Commissioners.\n|Data Year=2012-2013\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Quantitative data/text mining, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences), Semi-Structured Interview, Document Research\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining), Textual Content Analysis, Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data), Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Film and motion pictures; Software publishing (including video games); Sound recording and music publishing; Television programmes; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=Australia; United Kingdom;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Funded By=Commonwealth of Australia;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=295\n|Level of Aggregation=Stakeholders,\n|Data Material Year=2012\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=1,039\n|Level of Aggregation=Stakeholders,\n|Data Material Year=2013\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=109\n|Level of Aggregation=Focus group,\n|Data Material Year=2013\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2508, 'title': 'Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2001, 2006', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': ''}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2519, 'title': 'Australian Bureau of Statistics (2013)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': ''}], 'ns': 0}]}

In UK legislation such provisions are referred to as ‘permitted acts’ (Chapter 3, Part I CDPA 1988). The international standard is the three-step-test set out in the Berne Convention: the permitted acts must apply to ‘certain special cases’, must not ‘conflict with a normal exploitation of the work’ and not ‘unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author’ (Berne Convention Art 9(2)). Whereas US copyright law provides for a general principle of ‘fair use’ (17 U.S.C. para.107), European Union legislation provides an exhaustive list of specific exceptions (Art 5 Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC); the implementation of one exception, (concerning certain ‘transient or incidental’ acts of reproduction) is compulsory, but others are optional. The UK has always provided for ‘permitted acts’ through specific provisions (as opposed to the broader principle of ‘fair use’ in US law), including ‘fair dealing’ in relation to criticism or review of a work, research or private study. In recent years, the UK has included further specific ‘permitted acts’ within the parameters of Art 5 Information Society Directive, for instance data mining and parody. The full list can be found at Part I, Chapter 3 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988. \n\nThere is a significant body of work by legal scholars exploring the rationale for imposing limits to the rights of the copyright owner. Amongst other things, the literature has explored the relation between these legal provisions and (i) the public interest, (ii) innovation, and (iii) market failure (as proposed by Kretschmer, 2014). For example, an exception which enables the use of orphan works (those works where the copyright owner is unknown or impossible to locate) could be justified under (i) as providing greater access to shared cultural heritage for social purposes. An orphan works exception could also be justified in terms of innovation under (ii) as unlocking expressions for new creativity, which would otherwise be undeveloped, or under (iii) because the costs in locating and asking permission from unknown rightsholders are high enough that they make it impossible to contract. Similarly, the UK debate of a private copying exception in 2014,  justified it on all three grounds as (i) providing consumer benefit and convenience, bringing everyday practice into alignment with copyright statues, (ii) encouraging innovation by enabling intermediary services and (iii) addressing market failure by enabling a practice which takes place in the private sphere beyond the ability to contract. The exception was challenged according to justification (iii) with opponents arguing that it did not address market failure without an accompanying levy in place on writable media such as iPods and blank CDs.  Other European jurisdictions use consumer levies to raise funds which are used to compensate rightsholders for private copying which takes place beyond their control. The argument that such copying could be priced-in and thus reflected in the initial price of creative goods was challenged in the UK. and a need for better evidence identified (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors v Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills EWHC 1723 (Admin) (19 June 2015). https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/basca-v-sofs-bis-judgment.pdf\n\n\n''Policy interventions''\n\nPolicy concerns arise, for instance, from balancing the three justifications noted in the previous section, such as (i) the need to balance the public interest with other legal restrictions which may override the effectiveness of exceptions, such as end-user license agreements, contracts and DRM systems (see Favale, 2011; Hargreaves, 2012; Kretschmer et al, 2010); (ii) whether exceptions are compatible with broader political and economic objectives such as pursuit of a digital single market in the EU or new innovative digital practices (see Erickson et al, 2013; Mendis, 2013); and (iii) whether exceptions or private contracting would improve economic welfare, for example in choosing between a non-commercial exception for user-generated content or relying on proliferating use of automated private licensing (Heald et al, 2015; Karaganis & Urban, 2015). Some legal theorists and practitioners have proposed more radical changes to EU copyright law, questioning whether principles such as fair use or minimum standard user rights would be more appropriate legislative tools to promote innovation while remaining technologically agnostic (Dobusch & Quack, 2013). \n\n\n''Existing evidence''\n\nFollowing the Gowers review of Intellectual Property in 2006 and leading up to the implementation of the Hargreaves review in 2014, a significant amount of data were gathered from industry, consumer and policy representatives in the UK context.  These qualitative and anecdotal accounts nevertheless form a corpus which builds understanding of the various views and political stakes in the debates around copyright reform and exceptions (see Edwards et al, 2015; Erickson, 2014). Additional empirical data about the anticipated consumer welfare and economic impact of new copyright exceptions were collected and analysed as part of both review exercises (see for example the IPO impact assessments on Quotation and Parody).  [LINK]\n\nScholarly research on exceptions consists of policy reports and peer-reviewed articles. Reports by Favale et al (2013) on the proposed orphan works licensing scheme and work by Erickson et al (2013) on the impact of the proposed Parody exception are indicative of evidence gathered and used in the policy process itself. Both of these studies adopt a mixed socio-legal/economics approach which explores the appropriate balance of rights and consumer interests in the context of incentivising new production and use of copyright works.  In Canada, research by the CPCC (2008) on consumer music download behavior was used to argue for collection of a levy on format shifting of music content to digital devices, showing that format shifting behavior was a widespread practice.  Canada adopted a levy-free digital format shifting exception in 2012. \n\n\n''Evidence needed''\n\nIn order to evaluate and assess the implementation of new copyright exceptions, there are ongoing opportunities for researchers to provide evidence on the impact of changes to copyright in the form of specific exceptions, prior to and following their introduction. In the context of the UK, there is evaluative potential in the wake of the Hargreaves reforms of 2014. Research should verify whether there has been, for example, a measureable impact on audience or licensing revenue as a result of the UK parody exception. Comparative research and/or natural experimental methods are naturally suited to addressing these gaps for other national contexts.\n\nIn the case of newly proposed exceptions or potential reforms, additional empirical evidence is needed to assess and consider each of the justifications of copyright exceptions.  For example, while legal-theoretical justifications exist for promoting the public interest through exceptions (i), there is less empirical evidence on the impact of exceptions on metrics of public interest such as participation, access, uptake, and knowledge dissemination. Where possible, qualitative assessments should be supplemented with quantitative sociological research in these areas. This research is of utmost importance to balance economic concerns which already form the main pillar of national policy evaluations. There is further empirical legal studies research to be done on the precise relationship between copyright statutes and creative enterprise. For example, who is using fair dealing exceptions and why? What are the impediments to relying on fair dealing exceptions for those who would create new expressions? What will be the status of different national exceptions if Europe moves toward a Digital Single Market? What should be the guiding principles for weighing the public interest in future policy determinations involving technology and the market?\n\nA great deal of research has been carried out by management scholars and economists on the relationship between intellectual property and the ability of firms to appropriate value from innovation (Teece, 1986; von Hippel and von Krogh, 2003). However, a smaller proportion of this research has dealt directly with copyright, and even fewer studies have addressed copyright exceptions (for one example, see Haefliger et al, 2010). Further research is needed to assess the impact of newly proposed exceptions, as well as their scope, on innovation-based justifications (ii). For example, the status of override-by-contract on copyright exceptions is important because it re-balances the scales between platform operators, users, and rightsholders, with potential implications for innovation. Empirical research is needed to assess whether the gains in innovation enjoyed by users due to exceptions can offset potential harm to rightsholders or losses of control suffered by platform operators.  \n\nEconomic welfare calculations are central to policy decision-making around changes to copyright, as evidenced by the data used to evaluate the Hargreaves reforms. Economic approaches have been the most commonly applied methodological tools to assess copyright and they continue to be useful (Landes & Posner, 1989; Scotchmer, 2007; Waldfogel, 2014). The status of copyright exceptions requires further clarification in policy, which can be aided by rigorous empirical analysis. In order to further address policy concern about the status of exceptions in markets characterised by contracting and/or technological protection measures (TPMs), research must be conducted to establish (i) whether and how best to assert the primacy of exceptions and (ii) the anticipated economic impact of any proposed policy changes in terms of both industry growth and consumer welfare. \n\nThe issue of user-generated content is at the forefront of policy reform initiatives, with some groups calling for a broad ‘right to remix’ on one end of the spectrum, and industry support for commercial licensing alternatives on the other. Copyright exceptions are directly implicated in this debate, because they legally define what users can fairly do with a copyright work (such as quoting or parodying it).  Fair use and fair dealing principles are challenged by expansion of automated notice and takedown procedures that have become widespread on certain online content platforms.  Empirical work is needed urgently on the ability of notice and takedown procedures to take into account fair use and fair dealing in online settings, so that clear policy recommendations can be made to improve the way that user-generated content is regulated. \n\nThe principle of fair use has been extensively analysed in empirical legal studies literature in the USA, with a large body of research covering many different consumer practices in many settings (See Cheliotis (2007); Netanel (2011); Aufderheide and Sinnreich, 2015).  Somewhat less work has been done on the practical usage of specific copyright exceptions in Europe. There is therefore an open question about whether the ‘closed list’ approach adopted by Europe is the most effective way to balance public interest with copyright holders’ interests.  While such expansive questions are perhaps best left to legal theorists, there are practical empirical concerns that are worth answering in the European context:  How can the public interest best be served without prejudicing the rights of creators?

We exploit key differences across funding streams within the academic life sciences to estimate the impact of incentives on the rate and direction of scientific exploration. Specifically, we study the careers of investigators of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), which tolerates early failure, rewards long-term success, and gives its appointees great freedom to experiment, and grantees from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who are subject to short review cycles, predefined deliverables, and renewal policies unforgiving of failure. Using a combination of propensity-score weighting and difference-in-differences estimation strategies, we find that HHMI investigators produce high-impact articles at a much higher rate than a control group of similarly accomplished NIH-funded scientists. Moreover, the direction of their research changes in ways that suggest the program induces them to explore novel lines of inquiry.\n|Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00140.x/abstract\n|Reference=John P.

The NIH funding was given to projects while HHMI funding was given to an individual.\n\n*Found that the individuals selected for HHMI funding produced more papers with higher amounts of citations then their counterparts in the NIH\n\n*The reason for this seemed to be that HHMI funded individuals could abandon unfruitful project more easily and move onto something potentially more fruitful. In the NIH however the funding was given to the project which did not give researchers at the NIH the same level of freedom to switch projects when they were found to be potentially unsuccesful.\n\n*The HHMI also had a more flexible review process initially and a more generous termination process which gave the researcher a bit more security compared to a harsher review conducted on NIH researchers.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

The aims and objectives of the research were to establish:\n* the range of different approaches currently being adopted around the world to enforce\ncopyright in the online environment; and\n* the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and to what extent enforcement approaches are perceived to be working to reduce infringement levels.\nFinally, in order to accomplish these tasks, the brief required the consultants to identify where\nresearch is available on the level of online copyright infringement in each country. The countries chosen by the IPO for inclusion in the research are as follows: United Kingdom (UK); United States (US); Canada (CA); France (FR), the Netherlands (NL); Spain (SP); Italy (IT); Brazil (BR) and South Korea (KR).\nThe research consists primarily of a desk review of policy, legislation, research and data in addition to targeted consultation with government and regulatory bodies, legal experts, rights holders’ organisations, and organisations representing Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In addition to the country case studies, the views of the European Commission (EC) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) were also sought to better understand how countries are (or are not) liaising and cooperating on the development of joint approaches to online copyright enforcement.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/404429/International_Comparison_of_Approaches_to_Online_Copyright_Infringement.pdf\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/404429/International_Comparison_of_Approaches_to_Online_Copyright_Infringement.pdf\n|Reference=Ofcom Kantar survey; BOP (2010); IFPI (2014); Harris Interactive (2014); De Dios Montoro Pons and Cuadrado Garcia (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In almost all countries, policy has been slow to be implemented, with supply-side actions being the first to be implemented. \n\n* Action across the countries has been slow for a number of reasons, not least of which has been establishing who, within a rapidly developing technological context, is legally liable for infringement activities (subscriber, platform, ISP, etc.).\n\n* It has become common across the territories that ISPs can escape liability provided they take action when made aware of infringing material to which they provide access.\n\n* Except the ISPs, countries have differed in the degree to which individual subscribers and entities that facilitate or enable infringement are the target of interventions.\n\n* Countries have been moving to make it much easier for rights holders to act against sites that infringe copyright. Notice and take down approaches have been developed and streamlined in many countries to be very quick\n\n* In some cases, stakeholders have also raised concerns that notice and take down regimes merely displace hosting activity to other countries (c.f. the Dutch case)5 days in the Netherlands; 12 to 35 days in Italy, 15 days in Spain) and inexpensive\n\n* Demand-side action requires new legislation to be brought into place (15 years in Brazil, 5 years in the UK). These measures are contentious,  bringing rights holders into conflict with both ISPs and civil liberties / consumer groups and NGOs.\n\n* Only Brazil and the Netherlands have dismissed the option of setting up new structures or processes to deal with the phenomenon of online copyright infringement. This suggests one or both of the following, that:\na) existing legal powers and institutions were ill-equipped to deal with the scale and speed of the phenomenon of online copyright enforcement; and\nb) creating new laws and institutions has a ‘signalling’ effect to both domestic and international stakeholders that shows that the issue is being taken seriously\n\n*  The presence of dedicated regulation and legislation has, in several countries, prompted both:\na) The establishment of voluntary measures as part of the overall set-up (e.g. CAS in US, which helps protect ISPs from law suits or in lieu of a fully worked out implementation (as in the UK, where Creative Content UK has been set up in light of the delays in the implementation of the DEA); and\nb) The emergence of market-based solutions in some areas: e.g. services to provide due diligence for advertisers (e.g. White Bullet in the UK and the Internet Advertising Bureau in IT)\n\n*  WIPO takes a similar view to the Commission in thinking that the most effective enforcement mechanism in the medium to long term will be the development of a competitive legal online content market\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Arguably, it also reduces the need for new, dedicated regulatory measures and actions.\n\n* In the authors\' view, what has been striking in the development of national approaches to the enforcement of copyright online enforcement has been the lack of shared approaches between countries. This has certainly been the experience of WIPO, who organised a seminar on the role of internet intermediaries vis-à-vis tackling infringement back in 2005. However, member states were not keen on WIPO subsequently taking a clear, further role in this area and as they only act on member state requests, no further work has been undertaken to develop a harmonised framework or to share best practice by WIPO"\n|Description of Data=The research consists primarily of a desk review of policy, legislation, research and data in addition to targeted consultation with government and regulatory bodies, legal experts, rights holders’ organisations, and organisations representing Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n\n9 countries.

The findings are based on a comprehensive survey of 1808 UK respondents sourced via youth groups, secondary schools and universities as well as through media and social network and music partners such as the NME, Bebo, We7, Facebook and MySpace. According to the results, young people have large collections of digital music, some of which is acquired through the growing range of licensed digital music stores. However, they still want to own music on physical formats. Music remains the most popular form of entertainment among respondents, but there is a value gap between the popularity of music and the amount of money spent on it, especially compared to other forms of entertainment. The high popularity of filesharing remains unchanged since 2008, the main reason for it being that it is free. Another significant finding of the study is that the vast majority of respondents know that sharing copyrighted content is not legal, but continue to do so.\n|Authentic Link=http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/10867\n|Link=http://i.content-review.com/s/ebf223550adb6d7c64fa176200d66ec8.pdf\n|Reference=Bahanovich and Collopy (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The computer is now the main entertainment hub amongst respondents in the group under study.

Information Economics and Policy, 24(3), 187-196.\n|Abstract=Intellectual property piracy is widely believed, by authorities in both US industry and government, to be rampant in China. Because we lack evidence on the rate at which unpaid consumption displaces paid consumption, we know little about the size of the effect of pirate consumption on the volume of paid consumption. We provide direct evidence on both the volume of unpaid consumption and the rate of sales displacement for movies in China using two surveys administered in late 2008 and mid-2009. First, using a survey of Chinese college students’ movie consumption and an empirical approach parallel to a similar recent study of US college students, we find that three quarters of movie consumption is unpaid and that each instance of unpaid consumption displaces 0.14 paid consumption instances. Second, a survey of online Chinese consumers reveals similar patterns of paid and unpaid movie consumption but a displacement rate of roughly zero. We speculate on the small displacement rate finding relative to most of the piracy literature.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624512000388\n|Link=http://experts.umn.edu/pubDetail.asp?t=pm&id=84870387970&\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2007); Varian (1999); Varian (2000); Priest (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Both paid and unpaid consumption of movies rise sharply in self-reported interest in movies\n\n* Paid consumption rises with family income and unpaid consumption falls, though not statistically significant\n\n* Chinese consumers view lesser movies compared to US (30 vs. 50)\n\n*Unpaid consumption makes up far larger share of consumption for the chinese respondents (roughly three quarters) compared to 5% in US.\n\n* Sales displacement is smaller in case of China compared to US. Hence there is small damage from movie piracy in China despite large volumes of unpaid consumption. One explanation for this could be lower overall movie consumption in China.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Rivista italiana degli economisti, 14(2), 361-0.\n|Abstract=Using survey data on cultural consumption by about 650 university students, this article proposes a market segmentation and some "rule-of-thumb" managerial implications for the music industry. The aim is to show how technological innovation impacts on the structure of consumer preferences. Consumption behaviours, listening habits and musical preferences are explained by a large number of variables. Nevertheless it is possible to reduce this overload of information into two common factors (using "factor analysis"). "Cluster analysis" is accordingly used to group the students-consumers. The findings are then deepened in light of an econometric analysis. The analysis shows that the new digital technologies (for example "file sharing") may be harmful for the music industry only within one specific group of consumers. New technologies can instead promote music consumption (especially of live music) by the other categories of consumers.

Available at SSRN 2409811.\n|Abstract=Copyright law’s requirement of substantial similarity requires a court to satisfy itself that a defendant’s copying, even when shown to exist as a factual matter, is quantitatively and qualitatively enough to render it actionable as infringement. By the time a jury reaches the question of substantial similarity, however, the court has usually heard and analyzed a good deal of evidence: about the plaintiff, the defendant, the creativity involved, the process through which the work was created, the reasons for which the work was produced, the defendant’s own creative efforts and behavior, and on occasion the market effects of the defendant’s copying. Despite having this large body of evidence before it, the jury is required to answer the question of substantial similarity through a mere comparison of the two works. In this Essay, we report results from a series of experiments in which subjects were presented with a pair of images and asked to assess the similarity between the two works using the criteria ordinarily given to fact-finders for the substantial similarity determination. When provided with additional information about the simple fact of copying, or about the amount of creative effort that went into the protected work, we saw an appreciable variation (i.e., upwards) in subjects’ assessments of similarity between the works, suggesting that fact-finders are sensitive to additional information about the two works and the creators who produced them, contrary to what current law assumes. Our study suggests that the availability and salience of such additional information actively distorts fact-finders' assessments of the similarity between the two works, calling into question the purported objectivity of the substantial similarity requirement as a whole.\n|Authentic Link=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2184&context=faculty_scholarship\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409811\n|Reference=Wilkinson-Ryan and Baron (2009); Lemley (2010); Balganesh (2012); Manta (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Basic knowledge about the act of copying, meaning that one work was copied from the other, greatly influences individuals’ assessments of similarity. And since substantial similarity is presented as a question to the jury once copying as a factual matter is shown to exist, the substantial similarity question is structurally skewed in favor of a jury’s finding greater—i.e., substantial—similarity between the two works.\n\n* In addition to simple knowledge about the copying, additional information about the creator’s efforts in producing the work also triggers individuals’ intuitions that cause them to find a greater amount of similarity between two works. \n\n* Our study leads us to conclude that while it may be true as a matter of theory that liability for copyright infringement is indeed “strict,” in practice this is perhaps largely untrue, since decision-makers are indeed “judging” the defendant’s actions in assessing similarity. Given this reality, it is perhaps time for copyright law to reconsider its dogmatic adherence to a model of strict liability—in both theory and practice.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

We combine our indices with information on excess returns to equity from a quarterly panel of firms and estimate how the breadth of copyright affects the market valuation of firm equity. A typical statute that increases copyright breadth generates an increase in a firm’s excess return to equity of 40–209 basis points, depending on the exact time frame, the size of the firm, and the importance of the change in statutory law. A typical high-court decision expanding copyright generates a 13–105 basis-point increase in excess returns. Our results are robust across 4–5-year subsamples and the size distribution of firms. Our statutory findings are strongest in the most recent portion of the sample.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/505372?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/results.cfm?RequestTimeout=50000000\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Besen and Raskind (1991); Chiang and Assane (2002); Liebowitz and Margolis (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The authors have calculated measures of changes in copyright law derived from both statutory and case law; they find that within a standard model of firm-level equity valuation, excess returns to equity in copyright industries are significantly influenced by changes in the breadth of copyright protection.\n\n* The average statutory change broadening copyright appears to increase firms’ excess returns by approximately 40 basis points; if one focuses on especially important statutes, this estimate climbs to 140–70 basis points, and if one focuses on relatively larger firms over the most recent sample period, the estimate rises to 209 basis points.\n\n* To the authors' knowledge, this is the first evidence to suggest that the breadth of copyright law is important in determining the performance of firms in copyright industries.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Available at SSRN 2333839.\n|Abstract=For decades, U.S. domestic and foreign IP policy has been predicated on the assumption that U.S. firms dominated both domestic and foreign markets for IP products. In an effort to evaluate the standing of U.S. firms in IP intensive industries, this paper identifies the “nationality” of the leading firms in several important IP industries. The paper finds that for many industries, this assumption of U.S. dominance is no longer correct. This suggests that at times, IP policies adopted by Congress and the Executive Branch may benefit foreign corporations at the expense of U.S. consumers.\nThere is absolutely nothing sinister about foreign ownership of firms in IP intensive industries, including foreign ownership of companies originally established in the U.S. This is to be expected in a globalized economy with multinational corporations and complex cross-border supply chains. Moreover, many countries in Western Europe and East Asia are at the same level of technological and economic development as the United States. The critical point is that in such a globalized economy, U.S policymakers should no longer assume without reflection that the beneficiaries of protectionist IP policies are U.S. firms and, by extension, U.S. workers and shareholders.\n|Authentic Link=http://infojustice.org/archives/28840\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2333839\n|Reference=Ryan (1998); Espinel (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Four of the “Big Six” publishers, the largest English language trade publishers, are foreign-owned.

In 2011 and 2012, seven of the top ten companies receiving U.S. patents were foreign. 57 % of the global revenue of the fifteen largest pharmaceutical companies was generated by foreign-owned companies.

Available at SSRN 2333844\n|Abstract=Firms in the copyright-intensive industries frequently complain that copyright infringement causes significant lost sales, lost revenues, lost profits, and lost jobs. However, as has been noted in numerous impartial studies, the actual impact of infringement on individual firms, on industry sectors, and on the U.S. economy as a whole, is extremely difficult to quantify. In contrast, what can be quantified with relative ease is the performance of firms in the copyright-intensive industries in terms that matter to investors: revenue, profit, and most importantly, profitability. Furthermore, the performance of firms in the copyright-intensive industries can readily be compared with the performance of firms in other industries. While such a comparison may not demonstrate the effect of infringement, it could provide guidance to policymakers as to whether the copyright-intensive industries require additional government assistance in the form of new legislation or law enforcement resources. In this study, the authors have examined the performance over the past ten years of five leading firms in three copyright-intensive industries: motion pictures, publishing, and software. They then examined the performance of five leading firms in three other industries: construction, transportation, and mining. Finally, they compared the profitability of the firms in these six industries. We found that the firms in the copyright-intensive industries were more profitable than the firms in the other industries in every period examined.\n|Authentic Link=http://infojustice.org/archives/29916\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2333844\n|Reference=Band (2013); Band and Gerafi (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The authours found that the firms in the copyright-intensive industries were more profitable than the firms in the other industries. Additionally, in this ten-year period, the copyright-intensive industries’ profit margins on average grew by 3.98%, while the other industries’ profit margins on average decreased by 0.75%.\n \n* There certainly may be other industry sectors that are more profitable than some of the copyright-intensive industries. Moreover, the firms in the copyright-intensive industries may have been even more profitable if they did not have to contend with copyright infringement.\n\n* Nonetheless, the high level of profitability of the copyright-intensive industries suggests that the copyright system serves these industries effectively, and that they are not in need of special assistance from Congress or the Executive Branch. Because so many of the firms in the copyright-intensive industries are foreign owned, the profitability of these industries does not indicate that U.S. trade policy should favour them.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

It is argued here that the piracy rate is influenced by expected benefits and costs to the pirates. A model is developed using a set of variables that may affect such benefits and costs and hence piracy rate in a country, and tested for a large sample of 53 countries. The results of this paper suggest that the existing socio-economic conditions and the lack of proper institutions in developing and emerging economies may be responsible for high software piracy rates. One may, therefore, infer that the current trends of globalization and socio-economic development may help software piracy in developing countries.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036840500293276\n|Reference=Gopal and Sanders (1997); Gopal and Sanders (2000); Shin, Gopal, Sanders and Whinston (2004); Marron and Steel (2000); Cheng, Sims and Teegen (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results: \n\n*Higher per capita income improves the ability to pay for new software, and therefore will lower the piracy rate.\n\n*The piracy rate is not influenced by changes in the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality. This is because of the differing effects of inequality on piracy rates. \n\n*In the presence of LNYCAP (Logarithm of per capita gross domestic product in USD), which is a strong measure of ability to pay, the effect of income inequality is dampened.\n\n*Total revenue from the retail software market, as a share of GDP, has a positive and statistically significant effect on piracy rate.\n\n*The results on the inclusion of Openness (OPEN) as an economic factor show that a more open economic environment reduces the incentive to pirate. \n\n*If the market is open, and both legitimate and pirated software are available, buyers can easily see the benefits of buying the legitimate software, which comes with a warranty and an after-sale service. Obviously, this will reduce the demand and shrink the market for pirated software.\n\n*The results show a negative and statistically significant relationship between Corruption Perception Index and the piracy rate. \n\n*The results suggest that greater civil liberty suppresses the incentive for software piracy.\n\n*Countries such as USA and Australia, which have better record of civil liberties, experience a very low piracy rate as compared to very high software piracy in countries like China where civil liberty is often violated. \n\n*Inclusion of economic freedom indicates that economically free economies experience a low piracy rate. It is also true that economic freedom enhances market competition and eliminates distortions. This implies a depressed market for pirated software.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This will develop a more competitive market for software development.\n|Description of Data=The authors track per capita income, Gini coefficient, total revenue from the retail software sector, openness of the economy, degrees of corruption, civil rights and economic freedom on the rate of software piracy using data from 53 countries covering the period 1994 to 1999.

We called them the accommodating, aggressive and no copying strategies. The government’s social welfare maximizing monitoring rate endogenously determined the monopolist’s subgame perfect equilibrium strategy.\nWe showed that if monitoring is not socially optimal then either the accommodating or the no copying strategies are the subgame perfect equilibrium. In the former case the equilibrium anti-copying investment does not guarantee the prevention of copying while in the latter case copying is prevented with certainty. If monitoring is socially optimal then the accommodating strategy is the subgame perfect equilibrium and copying is not\nprevented with certainty.\nIn our model the government is responsible for detecting copyright infringement. Alternatively,\nfirms may initiate the detection procedure.\nPromotion of socioeconomic institutions may be an alternative to detection and anti-copying strategies to reduce copyright infringement.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Available at SSRN 1990153.\n|Abstract=This report examines data on the effects of Internet peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing activities on music purchasing which was obtained from a survey commissioned by Industry Canada. The survey was designed to inform Industry Canada's policy development work and ultimately therefore support better policy decisions regarding the copyright law in Canada. In order to support its policy decisions regarding the copyright regime in Canada, Industry Canada commissioned a survey by Decima Research in 2006 which was designed to measure the extent to which peer to peer (P2P) file-sharing activities act as substitutes or complements to music purchases. Given this purpose the Decima survey asked respondents to comment on their behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing, as follows:\n\nConsidering the songs that you downloaded for free through P2P networks during 2005\na) what % would you have purchased at paid music sites if they were not available through P2P\nb) what % would you have purchased as part of a music CD if they were not available through P2P\n\nAfter analyzing the answers to this question, I report on two key findings:\n1. three out of every four respondents said that if P2P were not available they would have purchased some or all of the music which they downloaded; and\n2. almost two-thirds of the hardcore P2P downloaders (those who indicated in the survey that they only acquired music by P2P) said they would have purchased one-third of the tracks they downloaded if the songs were not available on P2P network. This is estimated to amount to an average additional expense of $168 per person, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue for the music industry per year from this group alone.\n\nThis analysis of survey data then suggests that P2P downloads have strong negative effects on legitimate music purchases and that P2P downloading acts as a substitute for legitimate music purchases. One might reasonably infer from this analysis that stronger copyright laws would substantially increase music purchases and music industry sales revenues and, by implication, increase artist income, industry employment, economic growth and government tax revenues in Canada. My analysis not only focuses on an important survey question which to date has not been analysed by the researchers hired by Industry Canada, it also contradicts the results of the original analysis of the data commissioned by Industry Canada, first published on Industry Canada’s website in a 2007 report entitled, “Don’t blame the P2P file-sharers: the impact of free music downloads on the purchase of music CDs in Canada”, and then subsequently republished with changes by the authors in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics in 2010.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990153\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990153\n|Reference=Andersen and Frenz (2007); Andersen and Frenz (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Contrary to the prior study by Andersen and Frenz (2010) and analysis of the same data, Barker concludes that the presence of P2P networks reduces the amount of money spent by downloaders on legitimate music purposes.\n\n* Stronger copyright laws that effectively reduce and deter free P2P music file-sharing would tend to increase music purchasing and music industry sales and, by implication, increase artist revenues and industry employment and contribute to both economic growth and higher government tax revenues. \n\n* Weaker copyright laws reduce music purchases, music industry sales, artist revenues, industry employment, GDP and government tax revenues.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

ANU College of Law Research Paper, (4).\n|Abstract=We focus our analysis on how reported changes in P2P downloading by individuals related to their reported changes in CD demand between 2004 and 2005 to test the hypothesis whether P2P downloading may be reducing CD demand. All of our regression results (reported in Tables 2 and 3 below) show a negative association between P2P downloading and CD demand as might be expected. We consistently find a negative and statistically significant partial correlation between CD purchases and P2P downloads. The range of these estimated correlations is between -0.039 and -0.050, with more consistent, mid-range values coming from the difference on difference regressions (-0.041 and -0.043). This implies a 10% increase in P2P downloads reduces CD demand by around 0.4%.\nThis paper extends the work of Barker (2012) which analysed a question in the Industry Canada survey which asked respondents to comment on their likely behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing. In this study we analyse the respondents reported actual behaviour, rather than their likely behaviour in hypothetical situations. Barker’s (2012) analysis is consistent with our results here however in also suggesting P2P downloads have negative effects on legitimate music purchases.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2128054\n|Reference=Barker (2012); Andersen and Frenz (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*Negative association between P2P downloading and CD demand. Consistent negative and statistically significant partial correlation between CD demand and P2P downloads.\n\n*In this paper we have corrected for two fundamental errors in previous analysis by AF leading to their erroneous conclusion. First we corrected for the fact AF biased their results by excluding from their analysis the group of consumers who had completely stopped purchasing CD’s (potentially because of P2P activity) prior to 2005. This is the very group who were most responsive, or likely to have substituted P2P downloading for CD purchases. Second we controlled for the fact that the level of an individual’s demand for CD’s, and the level of an individual’s P2P downloading may be correlated simply because they are both affected by the same third factor, such as love of music, so that high (or low) levels of CD demand is likely to be associated with high (low) levels of P2P demand. Such a positive association between the level of demand and level of P2P downloading may have led AF to mistakenly conclude they had found evidence of a positive market creation effect, as AF regressed the level of individuals CD demand against the level of individuals P2P downloading. Instead we focused on the changes in CD demand and changes in P2P downloading, using data in the survey that AF ignored on 2004 and 2005 behaviours of participants. By focusing on a longitudinal analysis of how the change in individual P2P downloading behaviour affected the change in CD demand we were better able to isolate the true relationship between increases or changes in P2P downloading and changes in CD demand.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

In 2003 WIPO published common guidelines on carrying out such research throughout the world (WIPO 2003, 2012a, 2012b). \n\nThis paper presents a critique of a number of recent studies which have departed from the widely accepted WIPO approach outlined above and instead attempted to estimate the economic effects of what they call copyright exceptions industries (CEI) that rely on exceptions to copyright law. These studies in effect attempt to challenge the approach of the WIPO and assert that exceptions to copyright law might make a larger economic contribution than copyright law itself. \n\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) CCIA issued the first of these “copyright exceptions” or “fair use” studies in 2007, under taken by Capital Trade Inc (CT) which purported to measure CEI in the US during the period 2002-2006. CCIA has since commissioned CT to update this study in the US twice, first in 2010 , and then in 2011. In 2010 the CCIA further commissioned a study of the European Union (EU) this time by SEO Economic Research which adapted and applied the same approach used by CT in the US. Recently in September 2012 the Australian Digital Alliance (ADA) similarly commissioned and released two reports written by Lateral Economics (LE) that adapted and applied the methodology used in the US and EU to Australia.\n\nWe focus our critique in this paper primarily on the LE Australian study as it is the most recent attempt to measure copyright exceptions by applying the methodology developed in the US. Our critique of the LE approach however can be readily generalised to the older US and EU studies.\n\nThe main conclusions of the LE study of Australia we shall focus on then are that:\n\n*“flexible copyright ‘exceptions’ and better crafted ‘safe harbours’ would make a substantial contribution to Australia’s economic growth and innovation with negligible downsides for rights holders; and\n\n*the recommended changes would improve productivity growth. Over time the additional value added to the Australian economy is conservatively estimated to grow to around $600 million annually. \n\nThis paper identifies three fundamental flaws in the LE’s papers analysis that make the analysis unreliable and its recommendations irrelevant. \n\n*The first is fundamental weaknesses in the theoretical economic analysis of the costs and benefits of broadening copyright exemptions;\n\n*The second is fundamental weaknesses in the empirical analysis and in particular the methodology it adopts from earlier US and European Studies;\n\n*The third is fundamental weaknesses in the legal analysis.\n\nContrary to the LE reports this paper suggests that any weakening in the enforcement of copyright, through introduction of ill defined exceptions and safe harbours of the kind promoted in the LE reports, would have significant negative economic costs, and little or no benefit. \n\nEconomic theory further suggests that if there are flexible copyright ‘exceptions’ and better crafted ‘safe harbours’ that would make a substantial contribution to Australia’s economic growth and innovation, with negligible downsides for rights holders, then in all likelihood they would have already been agreed to in the market or may be expected to emerge over time through automated market based electronic payment systems.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2180769\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2180769\n|Reference=Rogers and Szamosszeg (2007); Akker, Noll, van der, Poort and Tewes (2010); Rogers and Szamosszeg (2010); Rogers and Szamosszeg (2011); Ghafele and Gibert (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This paper presents a critique of a number of recent studies which have departed from the widely accepted WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) approach by attempting to challenge the approach of the WIPO and assert that exceptions to copyright law might make a larger economic contribution than copyright law itself.

Convergence: the International Journal of research into New Media technologies, 14(4), 401-418.\n|Abstract=Co-creative relations among professional media producers and consumers indicate a profound shift in which our frameworks and categories of analysis (such as the traditional labour theory of value) that worked well in the context of an industrial media economy are perhaps less helpful than before. Can this phenomenon just be explained as the exploitative extraction of surplus value from the work of users, or is something else, potentially more profound and challenging, playing out here? Does consumer co-creation contribute to the precarious conditions of professional creative workers? This article draws from ethnographic research undertaken from 2000 to 2005 with Auran games (a game development company based in Brisbane, Australia) to engage with debates about the status of user co-creation as labour. The article argues that as a hybrid and emergent social network market these relationships introduce a form of creative destruction to labour relations in the context of the creative industries.\n|Authentic Link=http://con.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/401\n|Reference=Banks (2002); Banks and Potts (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* For waged labour, there is the threat of displacement by unpaid amateurs and the loss or redefinition of work. For amateurs there is the question of whether pursuing their passions through creative production is something to be constructed as ‘enabled’ by commercial entities or ‘exploited’ by commercial entities. \n* User-led production is messier and often driven by a diverse range of motivations that cannot be marshalled into the institutional forms of industrial style production. The consequences of commercial enterprises coming to rely on this form of production to varying degrees is not necessarily outright cooptation or appropriation, but the emergence of new social network market institutions and processes, in which the commercial entities are changing shape as they seek to harness the productive activities of amateurs.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

However, if there is to be any chance of evening up the power relations, users must be understood as having agency, and the characteristics of that agency and the forms of power it generates must be articulated in order to be mobilized. \n* In terms of policy and regulation the challenge will be to identify where intervention is necessary, particularly to address matters of equity, but not to stifle the innovation processes in doing so. Understanding the changed form of the market requires that regulatory interventions change as well. In the future, we suggest that research could usefully focus on the role of non-professional creators as they navigate and shape the emerging markets.\n|Description of Data=Data is comprised of ethnographic research with Auran Games obtained via analyzing transforming and reconfigured relationships between users and media industry producers.

However they provide rich insights into this under-researched topic.\n\nPractical implications – An understanding of these sophisticated underground file sharing communities assists the further development of legitimate online music systems to appeal to the large number of individuals involved in music file sharing communities.\n\nSocial implications – This paper provides an understanding of the practices within a subculture that is currently regarded as deviant and illegal, and contributes to the discussion and policy formulation on file sharing.\n\nOriginality/value – This study is the only known ethnography investigating underground music file sharing communities. These communities have not been systematically studied previously and the paper addresses this lack of research literature. This study is also novel as it applies actor-network theory to a context to which it has not previously been applied.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/14684521111176453\n|Reference=Andersen and Frenz (2007); Beekhuyzen and Von Hellens (2009); Kretschmer and Pratt (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Social inequality is being preserved by the status quo in regard to file sharing, which leads to an apparent lack of critical thought on the topic of file sharing and the systems which support such activities.\n\n* This marginalising of file sharers is often achieved through the use of language (terms such as “pirates” and “piracy”), and increasingly through the criminalisation of file sharing activities in most western countries.\n\n* Underground music file sharing communities are highly sophisticated, and can offer new ideas for the development of future online music systems.\n\n* Of particular interest was the discovery of the orderly nature of the community, in particular that there are strict rules in place for obtaining an invitation to join the community.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 549-624.\n|Abstract=Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 establishes the affirmative defense to copyright infringement of “fair use,” by far the most enigmatic doctrine in U.S. copyright law and by far the most important. Without it, much of our economic and communicative action would constitute copyright infringement.   Yet despite the importance of the fair use defense, and despite the enormous amount of scholarly attention that it has received, we continue to lack any systematic, comprehensive account of our fair use case law and the actual state of our fair use doctrine. Instead, our conventional wisdom derives from a small set of conventionally agreed-upon leading cases. This Article presents the results of the first empirical study of our fair use case law to show that much of our conventional wisdom about that case law is mistaken. Working from a data set consisting of all reported federal opinions that made substantial use of the section 107 four-factor test for fair use through 2005, the Article shows which factors and subfactors actually drive the outcome of the fair use test in practice, how the fair use factors interact, how courts inflect certain individual factors, and the extent to which judges stampede the factor outcomes to conform to the overall test outcome. It also presents empirical evidence of the extent to which lower courts either deliberately ignored or were ignorant of fair use doctrine set forth in the leading cases, particularly those from the Supreme Court. Based on these descriptive findings, the Article prescribes a set of doctrinal practices that will improve courts’ adjudication of the fair use defense.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.pennlawreview.com/print/?id=164\n|Link=http://www.pennlawreview.com/print/?id=164\n|Reference=Cotropia and Gibson (2014)\n|Plain Text Proposition=- Between 1976 and 2005, federal courts reported 306 opinions, 215 of which made substantial use the four factors of s. 107, which the author notes is a surprisingly small number.\n\n- The Second and Ninth Circuit reported the highest number of cases and heavily influence other circuits even though the decisions are not directly precedential.\n\n- The outcome of the case is heavily driven by the fourth factor (commercial use/effect on potential market) and less strongly driven by the first factor (purpose and character).  Factor two (nature of copyrighted work) has no significant impact on outcome.  Factor three (amount and substantiality taken) has minimal impact.\n\n- The influence of other factors outside of s. 107, such as publication or bad faith, are also discussed as affecting outcome.\n\n- Judicial decisions have consistently expanded the scope of the fair use defence.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Available at SSRN 1481272.\n|Abstract=Why do some individuals pirate digital music while others pay for it? Using data on a sample of undergraduate students, we study the determinants of music piracy by looking at whether a respondent’s last song was obtained illegally or not. In doing so, we incorporate (i) the individual-specific transactions costs that constitute the effective price of illegal music; and (ii) individual willingness to pay (WTP) for digital music, which we elicit using a simple field experiment and which we use to control for the unobserved heterogeneity of preferences between respondents. Our empirical results indicate that a respondent’s subjective probability of facing a lawsuit and her degree of morality both have a negative impact on the likelihood that her last song was obtained illegally. These results are robust whether WTP is estimated parametrically or nonparametrically. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1481272\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1481272\n|Reference=Gopal et al.

In other words, one’s WTP for music is driven largely by one’s full income, which includes parental income for the college students considered in this paper.\n\n*  Transactions costs significantly affect the decision to pirate music.\n\n* Respondents who had recently received an iTunes gift card were 15 percent less likely to have pirated their last song, and the lower the annual income of a respondent’s parents, the more likely she was to have pirated her last song\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

If the goal of the RIAA was solely to deter piracy, it should not have abandoned its policy of suing the people it caught pirating digital music. Indeed, after suing 30,000 people over five years, the RIAA announced on December 19, 2008 that it would stop suing people over digital music piracy. Our findings nevertheless indicate that the threat of legal action had a significant impact at the margin on our respondent’s decision to pirate music.\nMoreover, given that our sample is composed of college students, a university that wants to reduce music piracy could use our estimate of WTP for music to sign a licensing agreement with an online music retailer wherein students can download music at a subsidized price below mean estimated WTP.\n|Description of Data=The data used in this paper were collected using a web-based survey that we developed.

It starts by elaborating on the reasons for intellectual property protection, by reporting a few facts about copyright protection, and by examining reasons to become a digital pirate. Next, it provides an exploration of the consequences of digital piracy, using a base model and several extensions (with consumer sampling, network effects, and indirect appropriation). A closer look at market-structure implications of end-user piracy is then taken. After a brief review of commercial piracy, additional legal and private responses to end-user piracy are considered. Finally, a quick look at emerging new business models is taken.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/46520/1/639573924.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1698618\n|Reference=Gasser (2005a); Gasser (2005b); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2006); Hill (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This article extensively reviews the theoretical literature on piracy of information products. This literature, which started in the mid-1980s, really mushroomed at the turn of the 21st century when digital piracy became a topic of intense debate.\n\n* Initially, in terms of welfare, it was considered that piracy was likely to improve welfare in the short run (as the deadweight loss of monopoly is reduced) but to deteriorate it in the long run (as lower profits imply lower incentives to create and to improve products). These conclusions were established in a number of seminal papers considering a simple monopoly framework.\n\n* Subsequent analyses extended this basic approach in several directions. First, it was suggested that piracy also had the potential to increase the right-holders’ profits. A second line of extension was to examine the effects of piracy in environments where several digital products compete with one another. Finally, other contributions consider other responses to piracy than actions through prices, namely legal actions, technical measures and copyright levies.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

When the copying technology involves a fixed cost and no marginal cost, pricing decisions are interdependent.

Digital piracy. (2014).\n|Abstract=The objective of this note is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of digital piracy. Although the emphasis is on the economic analysis, it also briefly presents the legal context and its recent evolution. As digital piracy consists in infringing intellectual property laws, it is important to start by understanding the rationale of such laws. That allows a more precise definition of what is meant by digital piracy. The study then moves on to the economic analysis of piracy, starting with the basic analysis, which explains why piracy is likely to decrease the profits of the producers of digital products; also examined is how the producers have reacted to digital piracy when it started to grow. Next is a review of more recent contributions to the field that point at possible channels through which piracy could improve the profitability of digital products. These channels have inspired new business models for the distribution of digital products, which are described in the last part of the essay. Throughout the essay are reported the results of some of the most recent empirical studies, so as to quantify the impacts of digital piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7883-6_13-1#page-1\n|Reference=Belleflamme and Pietz (2012); Novos and Waldman (1984); Zhang (2012); Pietz and Waelbroeck (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Levels of piracy have negatively affected profits by copyright owning producers and businesses.\n* Empirical research provides mixed results when assessing the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures such as HADOPI in France.\n* Technical measures such as DRM were not successful and in general have been phased out of the music industry (but not book publishing).\n* Digital piracy may have a positive affect on profits as there is a 'sampling effect' where consumers may be exposed to the work and go on to purchase a legitimate copy.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Boston University. Available at SSRN 588763.\n|Abstract=Open source software, developed by volunteers, appears counter to the conventional wisdom that private provision of public goods is socially more efficient. But complexity makes a difference. Under standard models, development contracts for specialized software may be difficult to write and ownership rights do not necessarily elicit socially optimal effort. I consider three mechanisms that improve the likelihood that firms can obtain the software they need: pre-packaged software, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Free/Open Source software (FOSS). I show that with complex software, some firms will choose to participate in FOSS over both "make or buy" and this increases social welfare. In general, FOSS complements proprietary provision, rather than replacing it. Pre-packaged software can coexist in the marketplace with FOSS: pre-packaged software addresses common uses with limited feature sets, while firms with specialized, more complex needs use FOSS.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=588763\n|Reference=Aghion and Tirole (1994); Bitzer (2004); Bitzer and Shroeder (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This analysis may help dispel two myths about F/OSS (Free/Open Source Software):\n\n* First, it is not a “communistic,” “property destroying” alternative to proprietary software. It is better viewed as a complement to proprietary provision, recognizing that proprietary provision fails to effectively meet the needs of many customers in markets where customers have highly disparate needs and products are complex.\n\n* Second, it is a mistake to assume that F/OSS is somehow less robust because it is based on voluntary contributions rather than driven by the profit incentive. In fact, the firms that participate in F/OSS are driven by the profit incentive – F/OSS is just the most socially efficient means for many of them to obtain the software they need in their profit-making activities.\n\nManagers need to view F/OSS as an alternative to simple “make-or-buy.” This alternative will make the most sense for firms with specialized and complex needs.

Canada.\n|Abstract=The Creators’ Rights Alliance (CRA) is an affiliation of organizations, established in October 2000, representing copyright creators and content providers throughout the media, particularly television, radio and the press.\nThese organizations represent an important section of the UK’s cultural and economic resources. Their members produce the work that is at the heart of the information technology society, and vital to the future of the economy. However, increasingly concentrated corporations which control the media industries confront individual creators with ever more economically and socially unfair and abusive practices.\nThe CRA is particularly concerned that the interests and rights of its freelance members (who include authors, playwrights, journalists, directors, photographers, composers, songwriters and musicians) are being trampled upon throughout the media sector.\nThese abuses are perpetrated not only by the traditional pirates and counterfeiters but also, more significantly, by legitimate businesses: publishers, broadcasting companies, Internet Service Providers, data banks and the like who are undermining the work and livelihoods of the very people who are creators of all the content they wish to exploit.\nNot only are these problems economic, but fundamental rights of free expression are also under threat. Unlike the majority of their European counterparts, UK freelance creators are frequently coerced into waiving their moral rights, often irrevocably, to grant unlimited rights to publishers and broadcasters to edit, copy, alter, add to, take from, adapt or translate their contributions.\nIn commissioning this report, the CRA aims to highlight practices which are not only detrimental to the future of the UK’s economy but are presently devaluing and demoralizing the vast majority of creators and thus discouraging ingenuity, originality and innovation throughout the media.\n|Authentic Link=http://creatorsrights.org.uk/media/between.pdf\n|Link=http://creatorsrights.org.uk/media/between.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=* A number of abusive practices have been documented in various studies and consultations over works and in contradiction of the rights of authors, which are not illegal or even criminal under the law of the UK. \n* Because UK copyright is transferable like any other property, authors are vulnerable to the effects of the market. This puts freelancers in a difficult position as they are often bound by individual contracts imposed on them by publishers, broadcasting organizations and other entrepreneurs whose businesses have been created expressly for the exploitation of the works and who usually have the benefit of legal opinion. \n* The transfer of rights is becoming a standard business practice, often through forms that require authors to transfer their rights on a perpetual basis for a one-off payment. \n* The current UK system permits waiver of moral rights, which undermines the protections and calls into question their effectiveness. \n* UK contract laws are in conflict and often overcome intended copyright protections.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

If reforms are to have a significant impact, this will be through the adoption of collective agreements in particular sectors of the cultural industries.\n\nThree reasons why reform of the law of authors’ contracts is desirable at a global level are: \n* creators’ rights are human rights, and therefore strong moral rights and rights to \nremuneration should be available to all authors; \n\n* reforming authors’ contracts and moral rights at an international level will significantly resolve the problems of “conflicts of law”; and\n\n* international harmonization of these provisions will prevent exploiters electing to commission work in countries where the law protecting authors is weak.\n|Description of Data=Many of the datasets referenced are documented through various reports and consultations, especially through representatives of the various members of the CRA. \n\nVarious secondary data sources are used as support for recommendations and findings.\n|Data Year=Not stated\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Various;\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Ethnography, Life History, Historical Methods\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Analysis Methods, Textual Content Analysis, Ethnographic/narrative analysis\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment; Film and motion pictures;\n|Country=United Kingdom; France; Germany;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=The Creators’ Rights Alliance;\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2602, 'title': 'Benkler (1999)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Benkler (1999)\n|Author=Benkler, Y.\n|Title=Free as the air to common use: First amendment constraints on enclosure of the public domain\n|Year=1999\n|Full Citation=Benkler, Y.

Professor Benkler demonstrates that laws born of this conception are removing uses of information from the public domain and placing them in an enclosed domain where they are subject to an owner's exclusive control. Professor Benkler argues that the enclosure movement poses a risk to the diversity of information sources in our information environment and abridges the freedom of speech. He then examines three laws at the center of this movement: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the proposed Article 2B of the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act. Each member of this trio, Professor Benkler concludes, presents troubling challenges to First Amendment principles.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-74-number-2/free-air-common-use-first-amendment-constraints-enclosure-public-domain\n|Link=http://www.nyulawreview.org/sites/default/files/pdf/NYULawReview-74-2-Benkler.pdf\n|Reference=Lange (1981); Litman (1990); Barron (1967); Baker (1993); Benkler (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Expecting information to be owned, and to be controlled by its owner, blinds us to the cost that this property system imposes on our freedom to speak. \n\n* The First Amendment requires a robust public domain.\n\n* As regulations of information production and exchange, copyright and related laws are regulations of speech.\n\n* The position that information released into the body of human knowledge is free as the air to common use is not an empty aphorism or a transient policy preference.

First, they require the state to prevent people from speaking in order to increase information production in society. Second, the mechanism of property rights tends to favor a certain kind of increased production-production by a relatively small number of large commercial organizations.\n\n* Information should be free as the air to common use absent very good reasons to the contrary.\n\n* Judges and legislators faced with decisions that will lead to further enclosure of the public domain must recognize the constitutional dimensions of their decisions.

Management Science, 53(9), 1359-1374.\n|Abstract=Recent technological and market forces have profoundly impacted the music industry. Emphasizing threats from peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, the industry continues to seek sanctions against individuals who offer a significant number of songs for others to copy. Combining data on the performance of music albums on the Billboard charts with file sharing data from a popular network, we assess the impact of recent developments related to the music industry on survival of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P sharing on an album’s survival on the charts. In the post-P2P era, we find significantly reduced chart survival except for those albums that debut high on the charts. In addition, superstars and female artists continue to exhibit enhanced survival. Finally, we observe a narrowing of the advantage held by major labels. The second phase of our study isolates the impact of file sharing on album survival. We find that, although sharing does not hurt the survival of top-ranked albums, it does have a negative impact on low-ranked albums. These results point to increased risk from rapid information sharing for all but the “cream of the crop.”\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0699\n|Link=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=mgmt_fac\n|Reference=Matthews (2000); Alexander (2000); Harmon (2003); Liebowitz (2004); Liebowitz (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Debut rank has a highly negative impact on album survival, an impact even more pronounced for albums debuting lower on the charts. The superstar effect appears to be alive and well, with albums by such performers surviving approximately 35% longer. Albums promoted by major labels tend to survive longer than those promoted by minor labels. \n\n* Since superstars and debut rank are important markers of success, firms that do the best job in enlisting superstars and successfully utilizing prerelease marketing to impact debut rank are well positioned to succeed in the new marketplace.\n\n* There is evidence that minor labels are closing the gap with the major labels. The innovative approaches adopted by the minor labels might be emulated by major labels. In this vein, it has been suggested that sharing through online networks might have beneficial sampling and word-of-mouth effects. This study's results suggest otherwise, especially for  albums debuting lower on the chart.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Journal of law and economics, 49(1), 91-114.\n|Abstract=The music industry has repeatedly expressed concerns over potentially devastating impacts of online music sharing. Initial attempts to control online file sharing have been primarily through consumer education and legal action against the operators of networks that facilitated file sharing. Recent legal action against individual file sharers marked an unprecedented shift in the industry’s strategy. The focus now is on well‐publicized legal threats and actions on a relatively small group of individuals to discourage overall music file sharing. To determine the resulting impact of these legal threats, we passively tracked online file‐sharing behavior of over 2,000 individuals. We found that individuals who share a substantial number of music files react to legal threats differently from those who share a lesser number of files. Importantly, our analysis indicates that even after these legal threats and the resulting lowered levels of file sharing, the availability of music files on these networks remains substantial.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/501085?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n|Reference=Becker (1968); Ahrens (2004); Gopal and Sanders (1997); Gopal, Bhattacharjee and Sanders (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Pursuing individual P2P users through threats of and actual legal action has mixed results.

P2P networks have become lightning rods for debates on intellectual property rights and music market fates. Yet, to date, little has been based on actual observed activity on online sharing networks. Here we report on an initial P2P network data gathering and analysis endeavor and relate it to market performance of music albums. The relative market performance of music albums is gauged using the list of top 100 albums on the weekly Billboard charts. The P2P sharing data gathered is longitudinal, spanning a period of 8 weeks. We also identify and track data for 47 upcoming album releases providing pre- and post-release comparisons of sharing activity. We offer four main findings:\n(1) significant piracy opportunity and activity were observed;\n(2) the level of sharing opportunities are related to albums\' relative chart positions;\n(3) there is evidence of both “pre-purchase sampling” piracy and “lost-sales” piracy; and,\n(4) sharing activity levels provide leading indicators of direction of movement of albums on the Billboard charts.\nPoints (3) and (4) have particular implications for music marketing and promotion.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2004.11.001\n|Link=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/mgmt_fac/9/\n|Reference=Hellwig (2002); Krider and Weinberg (2002); Radas and Shugan (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=4 main conclusions:\n# significant piracy opportunity and activity were observed;\n# the level of sharing opportunities are related to albums’ relative chart positions;\n# there is evidence of both bpre purchase samplingQ piracy and blost salesQ piracy; and,\n# sharing activity levels provide leading indicators of direction of movement of albums on the Billboard charts.\n\nOther observations include:\n* Results call attention to the likely presence of a potentially powerful offsetting type of piracy that is refferred to as pre-purchase sampling piracy, where people download music to sample it before a potential purchase.\n* Evidence that the level of sharing opportunities online for music albums are related to their relative chart positions on the top 100 Billboard charts\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

For instance, online music sharing has prompted legal challenges and industry alliances, while raising significant concerns regarding the industry’s future. A study in 2000 reported 14% of Internet users had downloaded music for free. This number has grown rapidly, and online music sharing has been estimated to result in annual sales losses of $3.1 billion by 2005 for the music industry.\nHere, we strive to understand individual motivations to “freeload” digital music, such that affected industries could develop effective measures to combat the problem.\n|Authentic Link=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=792707\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=527342\n|Reference=Givon, Mahajan and Muller (1995); Gopal and Sanders (1998); Gopal and Sanders (2000); Waters (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Price of music and available bandwidth are found to have significant effects on piracy.

These same advancements, however, have also reduced the costs and increased the availability throughout the world of the technology used to copy or pirate these products. Consequently, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is among the primary concerns of software publishers, music labels, movie studios, and other producers within industries affected by piracy. Developers of information-based products have appealed to various national governments and international organizations for assistance in clearly defining and enforcing intellectual property rights at both national and international levels. Examining socio-economic influences on software piracy in the United States, the authors find a negative relationship between software piracy and income, tax burdens, and economic freedom. A 1% increase in per-capita income correlates with a 0.25% reduction in piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176505003204\n|Reference=Hofstede (1991); Husted (2000); Marron and Steel (2000); Depken and Simmons (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* As lesser-developed countries continue to experience economic growth and increased personal income, software piracy may well naturally abate. This does not imply that policies enforcing intellectual property rights are unworthy, but that policies that foster economic development and income may have an additional indirect benefit of reducing intellectual property theft.\n\n* One aspect of intellectual property rights not specifically included in previous studies of software piracy is integration, both economic and legal. The legal integration of the United States at the federal level, a characteristic not shared by multinational organizations, may help explain why software piracy tends to be lower in the U.S.\n\n* While multinational organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the United Nations may institute policies to help project property rights across national boundaries, the lack of economic and legal integration may ultimately frustrate such enforcement efforts.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2004). A study of online piracy and recorded music sales. Harvard  University, Working Paper.\n|Abstract=Ever since the introduction of Napster, the impact of file sharing on the music industry has been the focus of intense debate. The availability of songs on file sharing networks has two competing effects on sales that are likely to vary across artists.\nFirst, there is a direct substitution effect on sales as some consumers download rather\nthan purchase music. Second, there is a penetration effect which increases sales, as the spread of an artist’s works helps to make the artist more well-known throughout the population. The first effect is strongest for ex ante well-known artists, while the second is strongest for ex ante unknown artists. Thus file sharing reduces sales for well-known artists relative to unknown artists. Taking account of this heterogeneity in estimating the effect of file sharing provides strong evidence of this distributional effect. Additionally, I find a large aggregate negative effect on sales not apparent in previous work that failed to account for the differential impacts on more and less wellknown artists. The overall negative impact of file sharing arises because aggregate sales are dominated by sales of well-known artists. Using my estimates of the effect of file sharing, counterfactual exercises suggest that the lawsuits brought by the RIAA have resulted in an increase in album sales of approximately 2.9% during the 23 week period after the lawsuit strategy was publicly announced. Furthermore, if files available on-line were reduced across the board by 30%, industry sales would have been approximately 10% higher in 2003.\n|Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.2922&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2003); Liebowitz (2004); Mortimer and Soren (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Naïve estimates which do not allow for the effect of file sharing to differ systematically across artists yields results similar to those found in the literature previously, suggesting that file sharing has not had a significant effect on the sales of recorded music.\n\n* Further inspection, however, reveals that it is unrealistic to believe that the effects of file sharing are constant across all artists as the costs and benefits of file sharing differ with the ex ante popularity of the artist. This suggest that ex ante unknown artists are likely to see more positive overall effects of file sharing than ex ante popular artists are.\n\n* Furthermore, the differential effect of file sharing on the sales of artists of different levels of ex ante popularity has led to a dramatic shift in the distribution of sales among artists, as new and less popular artists are now selling more records while star artists have seen their sales shrink, compacting the distribution of outcomes.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The paper takes into account the traditional music industry’s value chain and distribution network, and the product characteristics of digital music as they relate to consumer value creation. We showcase changes in market structure from various perspectives of the players in the music industry value chain. With this as background, we then present propositions that highlight forces at work in market transformation and how each player’s role in the digital music industry value chain is likely to change. We note the new tensions that arise around intellectual property rights for digital music with market structure changes. We support the propositions with illustrative mini-cases.\n|Authentic Link=http://misrc.umn.edu/workshops/2004/fall/jesse.pdf\n|Link=http://misrc.umn.edu/workshops/2004/fall/jesse.pdf\n|Reference=Rainie and Madden (2004); Jiang and Sarkar (2003); Clemons et al (2002); Shapiro and Varian (1999); Conner and Rumelt (1991);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* With information-based goods such as digital music, software, news and e-books, most of the costs are in the development of the first copy of the good. Once developed, information-based goods can be reproduced and distributed at essentially zero cost. \n\n* IP enforcement is crucial to the viability of online information-based goods markets. \n\n* The separability of the digital music format allows consumers the option of buying individual songs through digital music retailers. This gives artists incentives to unbundle full-length albums and focus on producing singles for sale\n\n* The digital music market structure has implications for strategy and management in the music industry. Power is shifting. Artists, consumers, and digital music retailers are gaining more control.\n\n* Digital music sellers make little profit with song sales. Easy transfer and reproduction leave songs vulnerable to piracy, and P2P file sharing has hurt artists and record labels \n\n* Though the conceptual model presented in this paper is intended for the music industry, it is applicable to other industries. In particular, the quickly-growing downloadable movie market has similarities. We expect that trends in the movie industry will mimic those in the music industry.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues, 2(1), 45-67.\n|Abstract=In the modern theory of innovation, monopoly plays a crucial role both as a cause and an effect of creative economic activity. Innovative firms, it is argued, would have insufficient incentive to innovate should the prospect of monopoly power not be present. This theme of monopoly runs throughout the theory of growth, international trade, and industrial organization. We argue that monopoly is neither needed for, nor a necessary consequence of innovation. In particular, intellectual property is not necessary for, and may hurt more than help, innovation and growth. We show that, in most circumstances, competitive rents allow creative individuals to appropriate a large enough share of the social surplus generated by their innovations to compensate for their opportunity cost. We also show that, as the number of pre-existing and IP protected ideas needed for an innovation increases, the equilibrium outcome under the IP regime is one of decreasing probability of innovation, while this is not the case without IP. Finally, we provide various examples of how competitive markets for innovative products would work in the absence of IP and critically discuss a number of common fallacies in the previous literature.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.serci.org/rerci.html#Vol2No1\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1144885\n|Reference=Nordhaus (1969); Romer (1986); Boldrin and Levine (1999); Liebowitz (1985); Legros (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* An almost complete abolition of IP protection would lead to more creative activity, a more efficient allocation of its surplus, and higher social welfare.\n\n* In the standard model of innovation, no innovation takes place under NIP (non IP). While these may not be, and are not in our view, the empirically relevant circumstances, they are those almost invariably adopted to argue for the necessity of strong IP legislation.\n\n* There are abundant doubts on the established wisdom, according to which more IP protection is, from a social viewpoint, always better than less.\n\n* The presence of IP protection may eventually lead to an ever decreasing amount of creation.\n\n* A NIP systems allows the best creative individuals to earn large amounts of money.\n\n* In the IP system, income inequality gets larger  without gains for social welfare.\n\n* The starting point of the economic analysis of innovation is to recognize that the economically relevant unit is a copy of an idea.

Management Decision, 48(9), 1341-1354.\n|Abstract=Purpose – This paper aims to examine the issue of illegal downloading of music under an ethical lens.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The theoretical framework observed was one which included\nthree independent variables: individual, situational and experimental elements. The dependent variable of the study was legal vs illegal downloading of music. A 20-item questionnaire was completed by 84 respondents. The final four questions in the study were guilt-inducing questions(which the respondent was informed of in compliance with ethical primary research); the remainder of the questions were neutral in nature.\n\nFindings – The paper finds that the respondents illegally download despite viewing the act as immoral. Respondents choose to morally disengage from the non-ethical nature of the act in an attempt to avoid feeling guilty about illegal downloading and also to avoid any blame being attributed to them personally. Many respondents feel the act of illegal downloading is simply today’s reality and that there is nothing wrong or immoral about illegal downloading. Those who illegally download were less likely to attack the activity for being wrong. Active music fans were more likely to engage in illegal downloading than passive ones. Being a student versus being gainfully employed did not affect downloading behaviour.\n\nResearch limitations/implications – A limitation of the study was the difficulty in getting people to disclose the truth about their own ethical violations. A related limitation was the difficulty in obtaining respondents, since participation in such a study meant revealing their music consumption behaviour. However, in the end, social networking proved to be a successful way of recruiting participants.\n\nPractical implications – The results cast light on the obstacles managers in the music business face in eliminating music piracy.\n\nSocial implications – The results show the reasons for the difficulties in eliminating this widespread crime, because of the ethical ambiguity involved.\n\nOriginality/value – The study has the effect of explaining music piracy very clearly through the application of ethical/psychological theory. This has not been done before.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00251741011082099\n|Reference=Chiou et all (2005); Mazar and Ariely (2006); Shu et all (2009); Siegfried and Ashley (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This paper investigates this issue through an ethics/psychological lens.

Music Sales in the Age of File Sharing (Doctoral dissertation, Princeton University).\n|Abstract=In this paper I examine the effect of Internet access on compact disc sales. I combine U.S. census data on population characteristics with Nielson SoundScan data on CD sales for 99 metropolitan areas in the years 1998, 2000, and 2001. Controlling for year, income, and the fixed effects within each area, I estimate the relationship between Internet access and CD sales for four age groups. Overall, Internet access has a positive and statistically significant effect on CD sales. For children aged 5 to 14, Internet access has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on CD sales. For youths aged 15 to 24, Internet access has a negative and statistically significant effect on CD sales. And for the adult groups aged 25 to 44 and aged 45 and older, Internet access has a significant positive effect. My findings suggest that file sharing is not the cause of the recent decline in record sales, and that file sharing decreases the record purchases of younger people while increasing the purchases of older people.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/boorstin-thesis.pdf\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/253936719_Music_Sales_in_the_Age_of_File_Sharing\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2003); Bricklin (2002); Crain and Tollison (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Overall, Internet access has a positive and statistically significant effect on CD sales.\n\n* For children aged 5 to 14, Internet access has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on CD sales.\n\n* For youths aged 15 to 24, Internet access has a negative and statistically significant effect on CD sales.\n\n* And for the adult groups aged 25 to 44 and aged 45 and older, Internet access has a significant positive effect.\n\n* File sharing is not the cause of the recent decline in record sales, and that file sharing decreases the record purchases of younger people while increasing the purchases of older people.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The overall effect of Internet access on CD sales is positive. \n\n* Results strongly suggest that file sharing does not have a negative aggregate effect on CD sales, and certainly not a large enough effect to explain the current decline in record sales.\n\n* Even if the RIAA’s lawsuits against file sharers successfully deter people from sharing music over P2P networks, it would not be expected to see a short term increase in sales. \n\n* If the older demographic is more responsive to the threat of legal action than the younger demographic, the lawsuits would even tend to decrease sales in the short run. Lawsuits are part of the RIAA’s long-term strategy to eliminate the culture of free music, but they risk driving away people who use file sharing to sample new music.\n\n* Research has shown that different demographic groups respond differently to file sharing. Since so much of the file sharing debate has focused on the behavior of students, it would be interesting to study the effect of Internet access on their predicted purchases.\n|Description of Data=Data on population age, income, household size, and Internet access were drawn from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS).The three surveys used for my model were conducted in December 1998, August 2000, and September 2001. Each CPS survey contained about 50,000 households, which provided data for a total of 387,980 people.\nData on CD sales came from Neilson SoundScan, which tracks virtually all prerecorded music that is distributed in the United States. SoundScan collects weekly point of-sale data from over 14,000 retail stores, mass retailers, Internet sites, and mail order and concert venues.SoundScan provided me with yearly CD sales in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas from 1997 to 2002.\n|Data Year=1998,2000,2001\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=Current Population Survey; Neilcon SoundScam;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=USA;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None Stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=100\n|Level of Aggregation=DMA,\n|Data Material Year=1997 - 2002\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=387,980\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=1998,2000,2001\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1418, 'title': 'Borghi, Maggiolino, Montagnani and Nuccio (2012)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Borghi, Maggiolino, Montagnani and Nuccio (2012)\n|Author=Borghi, M., Maggiolino, M., Montagnani, M.L., Nuccio, M.\n|Title=Determinants in the online distribution of digital content: An exploratory analysis\n|Year=2012\n|Full Citation=Borghi, M., Maggiolino, M., Montagnani, M.L. & Nuccio, M. (2012). Determinants in the online distribution of digital content: An exploratory analysis. European Journal for Law and Technology, 3(2), 1-29.\n|Abstract=This article shows the phases – and discusses the results – of an empirical analysis addressing the legal business models that are adopted online to distribute digital content. Although it premised upon the idea that these models would have been greatly affected by the strong protection that digital copyright law offers to rightholders, it concluded the opposite way. The ‘all rights reserved model’ that is tenaciously incentivized by the current legislative framework is, indeed, all but dominant: it is overcome by ‘open’ and ‘interactive’ models that take full advantage from the architecture of the online environment and from flexible forms of copyright licensing. More in general, the results of the empirical analysis show that the current legal framework does not considerably affect the models of distribution that are implemented in practice; rather, they are significantly influenced by many other factors, such as the technology used for making digital content available.\nTherefore, the article acknowledges how the current legal framework is inadequate and inconsistent with the business tools that entrepreneurs are employing and testing to better satisfy the demand. In order to show how the market diverges from the on line distribution model of digital content envisaged at legislative level, in the first section we give an account of the digital age turmoil and expectations, so to show how evidence about on line distribution of digital content is needed. This need is further confirmed by the literature review about distribution models for digital content that we after carried out in section 2. In sections 3 and 4 we describe the methodology followed and present the initial results obtained, which will be further analyzed in section 5 via a cluster analysis. In section 6 we comment and discuss those last so to illustrate, in section 7, our conclusions. We affirm that while the current legal framework, though biased towards a pre-determined solution for online distribution of digital content, has not inhibited the development of a kaleidoscopic market for online distribution, an enabling legal framework could foster it further and, by doing this, could favour the match between the demand and the supply of digital content.\n|Authentic Link=http://ejlt.org/article/view/149/252\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2358899##\n|Reference=Litman (2002); Rosenblatt (2004); Fisher (2008); Giblin (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study shows how legal, technological and economic features operate as ‘differentiating factors’ among the models of digital distribution. In other words, it answers the question on what are the key determinants of the models of online distribution and to what extend the choice of the copyright regime influences the model of distribution:\n\n* The legal features do not represent the major differentiating factor among the identified archetypes. Technology and business, not law, are the key discriminating factor between models of distribution.\n\n* While technology and business are powerful differentiating factors, the models for online distribution seem not to be significantly influenced by the digital content which is distributed. To a certain extent, the same or similar model could apply to the distribution of music, videogames – and, conversely, the same digital content could be distributed according to different legal and business models. \n\n* The current legislative framework suggests a model that, initially, was supposed to be appealing for the business, as it enabled an enhanced control over the content distributed. Yet, entrepreneurs have developed a variety of business models which less and less coincide with what was suggested at the legislative level.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

We use a sample of 620 university members including undergraduate students, graduate students and professors to assess the effect of digital piracy on legal demand. A large\npercentage of respondents get pirated movies from a variety of channels (on P2P networks, intranet, by physical means. . . ). Surprisingly, approximately one third of the pirates declared that watching pirated movies increased their demand for films (for instance, it led them to rent or purchase videos that they\nwould not have rented or purchased otherwise). Using regressions analysis, we find no impact of piracy on theater attendance, and a strong impact on video rentals and purchases. However, movie piracy has no impact on video rentals for respondents who use pre-paid pricing schemes at video-stores.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1144313\n|Link=http://ses-perso.telecom-paristech.fr/bourreau/Recherche/movie.pdf\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2005); Waterman (2005); Coplan (2006); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Contrary to what movie producers are claiming, internet piracy seems to have little negative effect on theater attendance in the examined sample of people from the university community.\n\n* The strongest effect of piracy is on video (VHS, DVD) purchases and rentals.

However, if confirmed by other studies, results suggest that the video segment suffers the most from internet piracy and that on the contrary the movie theater segment could be able to generate stable or increasing revenues even in a world of illegal file-sharing.\n\n* New business models such as internet movie on demand could also be able to generate revenues from people who mainly rented videos in the past and who have switched to the convenience of watching pirated movies.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Analysis of music consumption in French graduate schools. Brussels Economic Review, 50(2), 167-192.\n|Abstract=This paper analyzes the impact of music file sharing on CD purchases. Traditionally, two arguments are opposed concerning the impact of music file sharing on CD sales. On the one hand, MP3 downloads only reduces sales of legitimate CDs (the "competition effect"). On the other hand, consumption of free MP3s could lead people to buy CD which they would never have bought otherwise (the “sampling effect”). Because the court in the Napster case and some academic researchers have dismissed this sampling effect, this article seeks to assess whether sampling does indeed occur and in the affirmative what are the relative contributions of the positive sampling and the negative competition effects of MP3 files on CD purchases. To do so, we administered an anonymous online survey in two French graduate schools from May 26 to June 3, 2004. We find that there are two populations: explorers and pirates. For the explorers, MP3 downloading from P2P networks has a positive impact on CD consumption. For the pirates, anonymous file-sharing on the internet and intranets has a negative effect on CD consumption, while physical exchanges have a positive effect.\n|Authentic Link=http://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/80196/Holdings\n|Link=https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/80196/1/Bounie1.pdf\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2004); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004b); Rob and Waldfogel (2004); Zentner (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This study shows that there are two populations of MP3 users: people who use MP3s to discover new music through file-sharing networks, which leads them to purchase more CDs (the explorers) and people who mainly use file-sharing networks as substitutes to regular CDs (the pirates).\n\n* New business models should discriminate between these two types of users of digital music in order to extract more surplus from the true music fans. There are already some initiatives which allow internet users to download an unlimited amount of music files for a monthly fee or match filesharing users to new artists. New tracking software also expands the space of products of which internet users are aware.\n\n* File-sharing technologies have amplified consumption patterns in the sense that music fans have used MP3 to discover new music and increase their consumption of pre-recorded music while people with low willingness to pay for music have used MP3 files as direct substitutes to legal purchases.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The online criminal provisions of CDPA 1988 are hardly being used, if at all. There has been a lack of clarity over how they can be applied, and even if this is addressed, they will not provide access to appropriate and proportionate sentences for serious infringement cases. If no change is made, this problem will continue.\n\nii. There is a case for increasing sanctions relating to online offences, especially if the civil case law is believed to have developed to a point where prosecutions can now be brought successfully against criminal activity. However, safeguards may be needed to ensure that ordinary members of the public and those whose copying is not motivated by a criminal intent are not inadvertently caught by any amended provision. Also, there must be a proportionate approach that permits legitimate experimentation.\n\niii. Custodial sentences in excess of two years have been used for physical copying offences. While no evidence was found of sanctions exceeding five years, the available data does not provide a basis for concluding that the level of physical penalties is inappropriate – it is rare to have the maximum sentence applied to any such crime, but important to have the means to establish a scale of offending.\n\niv. There is logic to placing serious online copyright offences into a more serious category, which soundings taken for this study equate with a maximum sentence of at least five years. The precedents within the IP landscape are either to leave offences outside the criminal justice system altogether (as in the case of patents) or to set a maximum offence on conviction at ten years. Fundamentally, either online copyright offences are capable of causing serious harm, or they are not."\n|Description of Data=Two files were supplied by the Ministry of Justice for this study. The first provided a listing of every case recorded on its systems that involved an offence under CDPA 1988 for the years 2006-2013, broken down by the main section(s) of the Act involved where possible70. The second provided a separate look-up of all other recorded offences relating to the unique case identifiers associated with the CDPA 1988 records.\n\nThe first set of Ministry of Justice data identified 2,808 people convicted of a copyright offence over the period.

Its scope, has been to gather quantitative data from 2006-13 and qualitative views and evidence from stakeholders, and to set out the arguments for and against any change in the law.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/405874/Penalty_Fair_Study_of_criminal_sanctions_for_copyright_infringement_available_under_the_CDPA_1988.pdf\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/405874/Penalty_Fair_Study_of_criminal_sanctions_for_copyright_infringement_available_under_the_CDPA_1988.pdf\n|Reference=Gowers (2006); Hargreaves (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Physical infringement offences have important differences from online ones\n\n* Online crimes are harder to understand\n\n* Not all prosecutors appear confident in bringing charges\n\n* The law is not as clear as it could be\n\n* Private prosecutions have used alternative legislation\n\n* Juries appear reluctant to return guilty verdicts on fraud charges\n\n* Even where an alternative approach works, CDPA 1988 does not benefit\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The online criminal provisions of CDPA 1988 are hardly being used, if at all. There has been a lack of clarity over how they can be applied, and even if this is addressed, they will not provide access to appropriate and proportionate sentences for serious infringement cases. If no change is made, this problem will continue.\n\nii. There is a case for increasing sanctions relating to online offences, especially if the civil case law is believed to have developed to a point where prosecutions can now be brought successfully against criminal activity. However, safeguards may be needed to ensure that ordinary members of the public and those whose copying is not motivated by a criminal intent are not inadvertently caught by any amended provision. Also, there must be a proportionate approach that permits legitimate experimentation.\n\niii. Custodial sentences in excess of two years have been used for physical copying offences. While no evidence was found of sanctions exceeding five years, the available data does not provide a basis for concluding that the level of physical penalties is inappropriate – it is rare to have the maximum sentence applied to any such crime, but important to have the means to establish a scale of offending.\n\niv. There is logic to placing serious online copyright offences into a more serious category, which soundings taken for this study equate with a maximum sentence of at least five years. The precedents within the IP landscape are either to leave offences outside the criminal justice system altogether (as in the case of patents) or to set a maximum offence on conviction at ten years. Fundamentally, either online copyright offences are capable of causing serious harm, or they are not."\n|Description of Data=Two files were supplied by the Ministry of Justice for this study. The first provided a listing of every case recorded on its systems that involved an offence under CDPA 1988 for the years 2006-2013, broken down by the main section(s) of the Act involved where possible70. The second provided a separate look-up of all other recorded offences relating to the unique case identifiers associated with the CDPA 1988 records.\n\nThe first set of Ministry of Justice data identified 2,808 people convicted of a copyright offence over the period.

Branstetter, Fisman, and Foley examine how technology transfer among U.S. multinational firms changes in response to a series of IPR reforms undertaken by 12 countries over the 1982-99 period. Their analysis of detailed firm-level data reveal that royalty payments for intangibles transferred to affiliates increase at the time of reforms, as do affiliate research and development (R&D) expenditures and total levels of foreign patent applications. Increases in royalty payments and R&D expenditures are more than 20 percent larger among affiliates of parent companies that use U.S. patents more extensively prior to reform and therefore are expected to value IPR reform most.

The law has severely reduced the possibility of such recordings entering into the public domain, at least until 2067.\n\nThis study indicates that there is an active and hardy network of foreign and small domestic companies, associations, and individuals willing to make historic recordings available; indeed, some do this in spite of laws that force them underground or overseas.\n\nThese circumstances create a complex policy environment.

C., Fromer, J. C., & Sprigman, C. J. (2014). Experimental Tests of Intellectual Property Laws’ Creativity Thresholds. Texas Law Review, 93, 1921.\n|Abstract=In the United States, intellectual property (IP) law is intended to encourage the production of new creative works and inventions. Copyright and patent laws do this by providing qualifying authors and inventors with a bundle of exclusive rights relating to the use and development of their creations. Importantly, however, these fields differ greatly in the ways that they determine whether some new creation is sufficiently innovative to merit legal protection. Copyright law sets the creativity bar especially low for new works of authorship, whereas patent law demands that a putative inventor prove that her creation is highly innovative. Relatively little research has focused on whether the different IP thresholds affect the incentives and behavior of creators.\n\nLegal scholarship on the effects of differing IP thresholds on creators has generally relied on standard economic assumptions about the way that people respond to incentives. Creators are assumed to be rational and to respond to increased incentives by producing more and better creations. According to this reasoning, because patent law requires more creativity as a precondition to the conferral of IP rights compared to what copyright law requires, creators subject to the patent regime will be encouraged to be more creative than those subject to the copyright regime.\n\nRecent research in the social sciences, however, suggests that the connection between incentives and behavior — particularly with regard to creativity — is not always so straightforward. Although some research indicates that providing incentives to act creatively has the expected effect of increasing creativity, other research suggests that offering certain types of incentives can undermine creative behavior. For example, monetary incentives to perform creative tasks may dampen creativity. Moreover, and importantly for our purposes, increasing the magnitude of an incentive to be creative may not always lead to more or better behavior. Once creativity incentives are sufficiently salient or intense, there is a risk that people will be overly focused on achieving the incentive and “choke.”\n\nIn the series of experiments reported in this Article, we extend the research on the effects of incentives for creativity into the realm of intellectual property. Specifically, we test whether the existence of a creativity threshold that conditions entry into a prize lottery on meeting certain performance standards affects how creative people are. The experiments reported here involve various creativity tasks in which subjects are randomly assigned to conditions that are intended to model the different creativity thresholds employed by copyright and patent law. Doing so allows us to test whether the existence and nature of a threshold increases, decreases, or does not affect subjects’ creativity.\n\nThis research contributes to the growing debates about whether copyright law’s creativity threshold is set too low and should be increased and whether patent law’s creativity threshold is appropriately set. More broadly, this research adds to the growing literature in law, psychology, economics, and management on the effects of incentives on behavior.\n|Authentic Link=http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/380/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443667\n|Reference=Arlen and Talley (2008); Fromer (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Hypothesis: If IP thresholds affect incentives and behaviour of creators. There were three types of creativity under study 1. Computational, 2. Verbal, 3. Figural\n\n* There were also different thresholds to get into the price draw 5%, 25%, and 50% along with a Copyright condition where the better you did the better chance you had at a payout and lastly a control where there were not monetary incentives.\n\n* Subjects performed better in the high threshold patent conditions compared to the copyright and control groups. Thus no evidence of either crowding-out of intrinsic incentive or a choking effect due to the increased performance pressure  brought on by the increased thresholds.\n\n* However there was little difference between the copyright and the control and between patent conditions. There is some evidence to suggest that some non-trivial thresholds for creativity would incentivize creation.\n\n* There was also a treatment where the task was a simple cognition task . Thus the authors could test if there was a difference in the way subjects were motivated differently by the monetary rewards in different tasks. They found that there was not a significant difference in performance between subject in any of the different threshold conditions in the cognition task, suggesting that thresholds motivate creative output more compared to non-cognition tasks.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Using a data set of over 8,500 price observations collected over a period of 15 months, we compare pricing behavior at 41 Internet and conventional retail outlets.\nWe find that prices on the Internet are 9–16% lower than prices in conventional outlets,\ndepending on whether taxes, shipping, and shopping costs are included in the price.\nAdditionally, we find that Internet retailers’ price adjustments over time are up to 100 times smaller than conventional retailers’ price adjustments—presumably reflecting lower menu costs in Internet channels. We also find that levels of price dispersion depend importantly on the measures employed. When we compare the prices posted by different Internet retailers we find substantial dispersion. Internet retailer prices differ by an average of 33% for books and 25% for CDs. However, when we weight these prices by proxies for market share, we find dispersion is lower in Internet channels than in conventional channels, reflecting the dominance of certain heavily branded retailers.\nWe conclude that while there is lower friction in many dimensions of Internet competition,\nbranding, awareness, and trust remain important sources of heterogeneity among Internet\nretailers.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.4.563.12061\n|Link=http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/frictionless.pdf\n|Reference=Haussman (1997); Bailey (1998); Urban et al.

In light of both existing theory and the earlier results on price levels and price changes, the dispersion in posted prices is surprisingly high.\n\n* Internet price dispersion may arise from two different sources of retailer heterogeneity: heterogeneity in customer awareness, and heterogeneity in retailer branding and trust.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Do Bad Things Happen When Works Enter the Public Domain: Empirical Tests of Copyright Term Extension. Berkeley Tech. LJ, 28, 1.\n|Abstract=The international debate over copyright term extension for existing works turns on the validity of three empirical assertions about what happens to works when they fall into the public domain. Our study of the market for audio books and a related human subjects experiment suggest that all three assertions are suspect. We demonstrate that audio books made from public domain bestsellers (1913-22) are significantly more available than those made from copyrighted bestsellers (1923-32). We also demonstrate that recordings of public domain and copyrighted books are of equal quality. While a low quality recording seems to lower a listener's valuation of the underlying work, our data do not suggest any correlation between that valuation and legal status of the underlying work. We also report important pricing data.\n|Authentic Link=http://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol28/28_1/28-berkeley-tech-l-j-0001-0044.pdf\n|Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2130008\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003); Heald (2008); Liebowitz and Margolis (2005); Ku (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main findings:\n\n*Our data suggest that the three principal arguments in favor of copyright term extension—under-exploitation, over-exploitation, and tarnishment—are unsupported.\n\n*Public domain works were twice as likely to be available in audio book format, and for the sample of enduringly popular works, public domain titles were 20% more likely to be available. These data suggest that copyright status, in fact, seems to reduce availability, even for the most popular books.\n\n*If the argument for copyright term extension turns on the need for incentives to reproduce older works or create derivative works from them, then existing empirical evidence suggests that term extensions are not needed and are probably counter-productive.\n\n*There is little evidence that public domain books are being over-exploited and worn out due to their unprotected legal status. The average price of recorded books in the full public domain data set and the full copyrighted data set was virtually the same, suggesting that the value of the public domain works in comparison to their copyrighted counterparts had not been destroyed by overuse.\n\n*When consumers go to the three main sources for audiobooks (www.audible.com, Amazon, and Barnes & Nobles), they will likely find that the public domain books are equally well read as the copyrighted books. The data substantially undermines any claims of debasement in the most important market for audiobooks.\n\n*There seems little reason to fear that once works fall into the public domain, their value will be substantially reduced based on the amount or manner in which they are used. There are considerable benefits to users of open access to public domain works. We suspect that these benefits dramatically outweigh the costs.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

All of the novels published between 1913 and 1922 have entered the public domain, while all of those published in or after 1923 are still subject to copyright protection. The list includes 171 public domain novels and 174 copyrighted novels, giving 345 in total. The goal was to collect a large enough sample of fiction from the same period that would support statistically meaningful analyses.\n\nTo test the underuse and overuse hypotheses the authors collected data on the availability and prices of audiobook versions of all 375 works. They searched the most widely used online retailers of audiobooks, Audible.com (owned and operated by Amazon.com) and Barnes and Noble, who sell versions in either CD or downloadable mp3 format. They also double-checked the results against the online listing published by Bowker’s Books in Print. The availability of free recordings of public domain novels from Librivox was also collected. Finally, in addition to noting the availability of titles, they computed the average prices of professional recordings across the different retailers.\n\nFor study 2, the authors recruited subjects through Amazon Mechanical Turk to listen to selections of audiobook recordings and to provide feedback on them, to test the tarnishment hypothesis.

J., & Sprigman, C. J. (2010). Valuing Intellectual Property: An Experiment. Cornell Law Review.\n|Abstract=Abstract: In this article we report on the results of an experiment we performed to determine whether transactions in intellectual property (IP) are subject to the valuation anomalies commonly referred to as “endowment effects”. Traditional conceptions of the value of IP rely on assumptions about human rationality derived from classical economics. The law assumes that when people make decisions about buying, selling, and licensing IP they do so with fixed, context-independent preferences. Over the past several decades, this rational actor model of classical economics has come under attack by behavioral data showing that people do not always make strictly rational decisions. Perhaps the most important research in this field is that related to the “endowment effect” – the discovery that, contrary to economic predictions, people value the same object more when they own it than when they do not. \n\nTo date, the endowment effect has been observed for a variety of goods including mugs, lottery tickets, and hunting permits. Our experiment establishes a substantial valuation asymmetry between authors of poems and potential purchasers of them. As we explain in detail in the article, we constructed a market for the poems that was modeled on a market for licensing IP. The observed differences in valuation indicate that IP licensing markets may be substantially less efficient that previously believed. Our results suggest that (1) the preferences of IP creators, owners, and purchasers are unstable and dependent on the initial distribution of property rights in creative works, and (2) large gaps arise between purchasers’ willingness to pay and sellers’ willingness to accept even though the poems are non-rival property and the contemplated alienation of the property is therefore only partial. \n\nOur findings suggest that private transactions in creative goods may face significant transaction costs arising from cognitive biases that drive the price that creators and owners of IP are likely to demand for transfers considerably higher than what buyers will, on average, be willing to pay. This does not mean, of course, that transactions in IP will not take place – we see such transactions happening out in the world every day. Our research suggests, however, that IP transactions may occur at a level that is significantly suboptimal, and that the baleful effect of cognitive and affective biases is likely to be more serious for transactions in works of relatively low commercial value, or for which no well-established custom or pattern helps to inform valuation. These results have considerable implications for the structuring of IP rights, IP formalities, IP licensing, and fair use.\n|Authentic Link=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3184&context=clr\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1568962\n|Reference=Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990); Korobkin (2003); Rachlinski and Jourden (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Financial incentives only increased creative output when; individuals where motivated by financial incentive to do closed creative tasks (tasks with a known goal or end) and in a group setting where the group had a common goal (this treatment group mimicked the collective corporate culture).\n\n* In other circumstances like in open creativity tasks (no knows creative target/goal) and when no team incentive were produced for groups the monetary incentives did not increase creative output.\n\n* Also found that men where more likely to take risks than women and wagered more money under know risk (coinflip), however under ambiguous risk (the exact probabilities of were unknown to the test subjects) men and women bet similar amounts to what the women bet under known risk which would suggest men are more averse to ambiguous risk than women.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Cornell Law Review, 97, 501.\n|Abstract=Despite considerable research suggesting that creators value attribution – i.e., being named as the creator of a work – U.S. intellectual property (IP) law does not provide a right to attribution to the vast majority of creators. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are a lot more complicated than that. \n\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to quantitatively measure the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a “creativity effect” that results in them assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced – creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be re-structured to provide attribution as a creator’s default right. \n\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, and paradoxically, our findings also suggest that before we restructure American law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators, we need to take care, because it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting. \n\nFinally, our findings have important implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently-structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.\n|Authentic Link=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/fac_schol/733/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1919210\n|Reference=Buccafusco and Sprigman (2011); Buccafusco  and Sprigman (2010); Landes and Posner (2003); Hovenkamp (1991);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* There was one experiment with three different conditions: 1) Contest, 2) Publication, 3) Attribution.\n\n* The first condition was the contest condition,  where the subjects could sell their rights to win a lottery but keep their property rights. \n\n* The second condition (publication)  was similar to the contest condition but the difference is that the photographer now had the chance to have their photo published, uncredited, if they sold their contest rights and won the lottery.\n\n* The final condition (attribution) is similar to the  publication condition  except the photographer would have a credited photo published if they sold their rights to the lottery. \n\n* The idea being that if the subject had a lower willingness to accept (WTA) an offer then they would be more likely to sell their property rights away, but keep the possibility to publish with or without attribution, depending on the condition. What the authors found was that when the photographer had the potential to publish a photo with attribution their WTA was lower than when there  was not a chance to get published with attribution. This result suggests that if  authors were not given attribution rights there would be more transactions of artistic works, which would make it a more efficient market.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Rev. 87 (2013): 275.\n|Abstract=The scope and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) laws are becoming salient, for the first time, to a wide cohort of U.S. and international communities. National and international legislation, including the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), have generated protests online and in the streets by people who are concerned about the expansion of IP rights. Common to each of these proposals was an expansion in the use of criminal sanctions to deter IP violations. Many copyright owners and the associations that represent them support criminal enforcement of IP, including the use of imprisonment, to combat the threat of increased IP piracy on the internet and throughout a globalized economy. Others, including a heterogeneous coalition of scholars, activists, and internet based companies like Google and Wikipedia, fear that using criminal sanctions to protect IP will expand already overgrown rights and chill valuable expressive and inventive behavior.\n|Authentic Link=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/scal87&div=11&id=&page=\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2297488\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003); Lemley (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Scholars and stakeholders have been wrong to assume that criminal sanctions for IP infringement are justified on economic grounds. It is true that criminal sanctions could play an important role in preventing harmful\nbehavior that cannot be deterred through other means. But imposing criminal sanctions is costly. For patent infringement, the costs of imposing criminal sanctions are very unlikely to exceed its benefits. Civil sanctions will probably be sufficient for creating the optimal amount of infringing behavior. For copyright infringement, civil sanctions alone should be sufficient to deter nearly all types of harmful conduct. There is an economic case for imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement only with respect to a discrete set of activities: massive reproduction and sales of commercially valuable works. We have arrived at the conclusion that the case for criminal IP sanctions is weak or nonexistent while putting to one side both noneconomic considerations, such as moral or deontological objections to criminal IP sanctions, and economic concerns about the efficacy of IP in promoting innovation. Once those considerations are added to the calculus, we suspect that the argument for criminal sanctions for IP infringement will disintegrate almost entirely.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Criminal sanctions for IP infringement are thought to be justified by the possibility of deterring or incapacitating would-be infringers. When criminal IP sanctions have been criticized, the criticism has usually come from a normative position outside of economics-moral rights, for instance." The economic case for criminal sanctions is usually treated as unassailable. We do not believe that the case for criminal sanctions in IP is nearly as strong as many have treated it. Indeed, we will argue that criminal liability may be justified only in one small corner of IP law, in response to one discrete type of infringement.\n|Description of Data=This study compares two systems of copyright enforcement, one with high level of enforcement and the criminalisation of infringement, and one with low enforcement. The study also compares the treatment of patent enforcement compared to copyright enforcement.

Paid music services have failed to deliver on their promise of a full-catalog shopping experience so far, and filesharing platforms are still widely used for obtainingonline music. In this context we conducted an empirical study via the Internet with 2.260 participants. The main results are:\nNeither the installation of copy protection measures nor legal actions against users of file-sharing platforms seem to be appropriate means to increase sales of CDs and online music. \nPotential consumers’ willingness topay is distinctly lower than the prices currently set by the available paid music services. \nOur study's results suggest that a price cut for music downloads would lead to increased sales, thus creating benefits for both suppliers and consumers.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03250984\n|Link=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1142&context=ecis2005\n|Reference=Naghavi and Schulze (2001); Kwok et al.

A prerequisite for the implementation of such a low price strategy is cooperation between the parties involved in the digital music supply chain, i. e. musicians/composers, labels, collecting societies, distributors as well as technological and financial service providers. If these parties considered themselves a cooperation network, this network could earn more money with a low price strategy than with the policy pursued until now.\n|Description of Data=A explorative survey was conducted over the Internet from December 8th, 2003 until January 19th, 2004.

Mass digitisation/orphan works (non-use; extended collective licensing)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "''The issue''\n\nThe declining cost of digital technology has made it possible to reproduce, manipulate and catalogue large quantities of data. This makes it feasible for cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) to digitise their physical collections (Borghi & Karapapa, 2013; Nelson & Irwin, 2014). For example, the Bibliothèque nationale de France has announced plans to digitise 500,000 works contained in its collection with national government support (Delorme, 2011). In partnership with a number of national libraries, search engine company Google initiated a project in 2004 to digitise some 20 million books at an estimated cost of $30 USD per book (Samuelson, 2009). Supporters of mass digitisation have advanced a number of justifications for these efforts, including the need to promote competitiveness in the digital economy (Hargreaves, 2012), to fulfil the mandate of cultural institutions to curate and preserve the national cultural memory (Covey, 2005), and to promote cross-cultural exchange and mutual understanding through access to information (Borghi & Karapapa, 2013). The economic and cultural justifications for digitisation often overlap, for example in the European Commission’s stated aim to pursue a cross-territory universal digital library while at the same time closing a perceived ‘knowledge gap’ with the USA (European Commission, 2011).\n\nA major impediment to mass digitisation of cultural works has been copyright law. While the technical costs of digitisation have decreased, the cost imposed on CHIs by the need to locate and ask permission of rightsholders have risen as a proportion of the cost of digitisation (Covey, 2005). This is particularly the case when CHIs seek to digitise entire collections of works, because there is often a significant number of items with rightsholders who cannot be identified or located, even after a diligent search. These materials have been referred to as ‘orphan works’ owing to their status as likely being inside of copyright protection but without known rights owners from whom to ask permission for use (Borghi & Karapapa, 2013). Investment in mass digitisation could be hindered by the high transaction costs of searching for and locating rightsholders, and by the inability to locate some rightsholders which may prevent digitisation entirely of some portion of a collection.\n\n\n''Policy interventions''\n\nThe European Commission’s Impact Assessment on the Cross-Border Online Access to Orphan Works (2011) identified 6 potential policy interventions, several of which were based on existing legal approaches undertaken in certain national jurisdictions. These were:\n\n1) Do nothing: without a legislative solution to the problem of orphan works, CHIs and other users in Europe would proceed under the existing copyright framework in their national jurisdictions. Digitisation of works in the public domain, or works in copyright where permission was obtained, could proceed. CHIs could independently adopt a ‘risk-based’ approach to digitisation of orphan works (See Stobo et al, 2013). The Commission’s Impact Assessment predicted that innovative ground would be lost to other territories, in particular the USA, where the fair use ruling in the Google Books court case permitted the search engine operator to proceed with digitisation under an ‘opt-out’ arrangement.\n\n2) Statutory exception for libraries: this proposal would create an exception to copyright for libraries to provide online access to works determined to be orphans following a diligent search. Legal guidelines would define the requirements for an adequately ‘diligent’ search, however no central authority would monitor the diligence of searches. In the case of re-emergence of a rightsholder, libraries could still be liable for copyright infringement if the search was found not found to be adequately diligent in order to benefit from the exception.\n\n3) Extended collective licensing: by granting collecting societies the ability to issue licenses for works not held in their repertoires, European Union Member States could make it possible for CHIs to obtain licensed use of orphan works in mediums where there is a relevant collecting society. This model is already used by libraries in Norway, where a fixed fee per digitised page is paid annually to an author’s collecting society. The authors of the Impact Assessment expressed concern that license fees could be high or equivalent to licenses for commercial works, leading to a failure to solve the ‘orphan works paradox’. This paradox arises from the lack of interest in licensing orphans due to their low commercial appeal. Also, without a diligent search requirement, CHIs in other jurisdictions would not be able to benefit from recognition of the legal status of the work, and would be required to negotiate separately with collecting societies, increasing transaction costs.\n\n4) Orphan works-specific license for libraries: in this option, the orphaned status of a work would be established via diligent search in the country of first publication and then a license would be obtained from a collecting society with authority in the relevant medium. Legal certainty would thus be achieved whilst eliminating the need for duplicated searches by CHIs in other national jurisdictions. This would permit the establishment of cross-territory digital libraries, but would introduce two sources of costs for libraries: the diligent search cost which would be required to establish legal status, in addition to any fees paid to the licensing society.\n\n5) Centrally granted national license for orphan works: in this model, which is currently used in Canada and the UK, a central national authority grants licenses to users of orphan works. Under the UK Orphan Works Licensing Scheme (OWLS) the Intellectual Property Office administers licensing of works determined to be orphan through an application procedure, for both commercial and non-commercial use, with licenses lasting for 7 years, and the management of fees paid by commercial users to compensate rightsholders in the event of re-emergence. The European Commission Impact Assessment expressed concern that such national licensing schemes hinder cross-territory digital libraries by fragmenting the legal definition of orphan status and diligent search requirement among national jurisdictions.\n\n6) Mutual recognition of orphan works made available by libraries: this policy option would create a legal framework on the definition of orphan works recognised across European Member States. After meeting the requirement of a diligent search in the country of first publication (with diligent search guidelines mandated at the European level and harmonised in national jurisdictions), institutions could digitally make available orphan works held in their collections. Mutual recognition of orphan status between territories would reduce duplication or search and expand collaboration. This option offers less legal certainty than a license; in the case of emergence of a rightsholder a user could still be liable for copyright infringement if the search was found to lack sufficient diligence to benefit from the exception.\n\nThe EU Directive on Orphan Works (2012/28/EU) was introduced on 29th October 2014. It closely follows the mutual recognition of orphan works option (6) outlined in the Impact Assessment, with a central repository for diligent search records established at the Office for the Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM), now the European Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The UK adopted its own orphan works licensing scheme in October 2014, which exists in addition to the non-commercial exception created by Directive 2012/28/EU.\n\n\n''Existing evidence''\n\nA significant number of empirical studies have assessed the costs of rights clearance for CHIs and estimated the proportion of orphan works contained in collections. For example, a study by Covey (2005) conducted at Carnegie Mellon university examined 277 randomly selected book titles held in the university library and recorded the costs of rights clearance. For 19% of the books in the sample, a rightsholder could not be located. Of the 81% of titles where a rightsholder was located, 34% did not respond to the requests for permission. A further 37% of rightsholders denied permission to digitize the work, while 30% of those contacted agreed to digitisation. Calculating transaction costs (labour and material costs of searching for rightsholders not including agreed fees) the researchers estimated $200 USD per cleared work.\n\nA similar study by Stratton (2011) recorded information on the cost of locating rightsholders in a sample of 140 books published between 1870 and 2010 and held by the British Library. The study sought to identify the resource costs required to ascertain the copyright status of the material as well as the proportion of orphan works in the sample. Of the total sample, 29% of titles were found to be in the public domain due to expiration of copyright term while 71% of works were judged to be in-copyright. Of those in copyright, 43% were determined to be orphan works after a diligent search, corresponding to 31% of the total sample of 140 works. The results are in line with findings from a number other studies of library collections of 19th and 20th Century printed material (Covey, 2005; Dickson, 2010). Studies on other types of material have confirmed the presence of orphan works, but in different proportions depending on the nature of the collection and the medium under study. An internal study performed by the BBC and cited by both Ian Hargreaves (2011) and the UK IPO (2013) in support of a legislative solution to orphan works examined 1000 hours of factual TV programming contained in the BBC archives. The broadcaster reportedly spent 6.5 hours and £91 searching for and clearing the rights in each hour of archival programming. No indication was provided on the proportion of rightsholders that could not be located. Reporting on rights clearance costs in sound recordings, The British Library (2011) described an effort to digitise 220 analogue recordings of oral histories with jazz musicians. The recordings were originally made in the 1980s. A search for 200 rightsholders between 2005-2007 was able to successfully clear copyright permissions in 53.5% of cases. A remaining 26.5% of the collection remained orphaned, even after extensive search. A study by Stobo et al (2016, forthcoming) on mixed collection of scrapbook materials found a high proportion (80%) of orphan works due to the partial nature of items in the collection.\n\n\n''Evidence needed''\n\nOwing to the relatively recent implementation of orphan works legislation in a number of jurisdictions, there is limited empirical evidence on the costs and benefits of policy approaches, with the exception of a small number of recently published studies. A comparative study by Favale et al (2013) evaluated the commercial and non-commercial use of orphan works in seven jurisdictions with operational orphan works regulations. The study used a rights clearance simulation methodology to ascertain and compare the license fees for a set number of uses of orphan works, finding wide divergence in costs from one jurisdiction to another. A similar study by Stobo et al. (2016, forthcoming) carried out a rights clearance simulation exercise on a sample of mixed-media works contained in the Edwin Morgan scrapbooks at the University of Glasgow Library. The study recorded costs of complying with both the national UK IPO licensing scheme as well as the diligent search requirements of EU Directive 2012/28/EU. The study found that high licensing fees and transaction costs introduced by the diligent search requirements in these schemes limited the effectiveness of the policies for promoting mass digitisation.\n\nDue to its focus on tabulating the costs of rights clearance and the size of the orphan works problem, much existing empirical work remains descriptive. Some of this work has begun to explore causal effects, showing potential for more sophisticated statistical research to draw inferences from new or existing datasets on orphan works. For example, Covey (2005) has suggested exploring the relationship between publication date, costs of identifying rightsholder and likelihood of a fee payment request. Akmon (2010) found a statistically significant relationship between type of rightsholder (commercial, individual, government, educational) and likelihood of a positive response once located, with commercial rightsholders more likely than others to refuse permission. In a study with the Wellcome Trust, Stobo et al (2013) approached the question of likelihood of rightsholder re-emergence, to evaluate effectiveness of risk-based strategies. In order to better assess national policy approaches to orphan works, it would be helpful to generate understanding about the welfare effects of these policies, considering transaction costs introduced by diligent search requirements and other formal procedures, costs to rightsholders and their ability to seek redress, and economic and social benefits of creation of digital collections. More optimal license fee structures and diligent search requirements are likely possible (for example in order to encourage mass digitisation) even within existing orphan works regulations.\n\n\n''References''\n\nAkmon, D.

(2013) Private Copying, IPO, 2013\n|Abstract=This study was commissioned by the UK IPO to collect data on whether and how four copyright industries – music, film, publishing and software – have (or not) adopted private copying measures, and on whether the price of the products in the UK reflect a right to private copying.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/309681/ipresearch-private-150313.pdf\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/309681/ipresearch-private-150313.pdf\n|Reference=Kretschmer (2011); Hargreaves (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Music\n\n* No evidence in support of a widely-held view that stores are including in their price the permission to copy. All digital albums are allowed to be copied for personal use, as opposed to CD albums that cannot be copied. \n\n* In spite of this, digital music is associated with a lower price compared to a CD. Whether the lower price depends on the store, on the intangible nature of the product, or on the possibility to copy, cannot be determined due to the lack of variability in the explanatory variables. \n\n* As private copying for personal use is widespread and allowed in the UK, it is plausible that private copying is already largely or fully priced in the UK market. Consumers and producers of music appear to expect that music will be copied for personal non-commercial use and all downloads are sold on these terms.\n\nFilm\n\n* In parallel with traditional films, which come with only one license (e.g. Blu-Ray and DVD), the film industry has found different ways to allow users to have more than one copy of the films they purchase. Examples can be found in the sales of digital films (which could be copied onto a number devices), by bundling multiple formats in the same package (which may also include a complimentary downloadable digital copy), or through new kinds of licenses, such as Ultraviolet. \n\n* The study found a positive relationship between price and film copies. In particular, since different types of formats have different impacts on price, we can conclude that film stores charge users not simply to have more copies, but to have the opportunity to choose from a higher variety of available choices.\n\nBooks\n\n* All the bookstores in the sample allow users to make copies of their eBooks. In particular, the copying terms and conditions are enforced using technologies embedded in the eBooks (DRMs) which are able to limit the number of copies that users is allowed and the kinds of devices in which the eBooks may be read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, eBook readers). \n\n* The influence of the number of copies allowed and the number of allowable devices on the price could not be determined because (1) of the lack of variability in the explanatory variables, and (2) to the fact that the large majority of price dissimilarities were captured by the difference between traditional books and eBooks. \n\n* However, when considering that they are allowed to be copied, eBooks are on average less expensive than physical books (which are not allowed to be copied). This premium for a physical book is of course likely to be explained by manufacturing costs and the value consumers place on physical features, rather than on the number of copies that can be made from it.\n\nSoftware\n\n* This market case was used partly as a control case as it would notionally not be affected by a private copying exception. However, it is a  sector, which actively tries to price for additional copies. \n\n* The analysis suggests that software producers charge a price that reflects the possibility of making additional copies. In other words, a higher number of copies is associated with an increase in the price. However, this effect becomes smaller as the number of copies increases.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(1988). The impact of video recorders on cinema attendance. Journal of Cultural Economics, 12(1), 73-80.\n|Abstract=Cinema attendances in the United Kingdom and the United States have been subject to severe declines in the post-war period. Fairly strong evidence (Belson, 1958) exists that the arrival and development of television contributed powerfully to the initial decline. As\ntelevisions now populate almost every home we would expect this influence to have worked itself out. The 1980's have seen the arrival of videos as a new threat to cinema takings. Analysts of the industry have been suggesting (Docherty et. al., 1986), (Variety, 1985) that the threat is more apparent than real with demographic factors and/or poor films being the cause of more recent audience declines. These claims derive from casual inspection of ticket receipts (Variety, 1985) or one-off surveys of consumer attitudes (Docherty et. al., 1986). To date there has been no concrete evidence offered for or against the impact of video. Such evidence is hard to gather because of data limitations. This is particularly the case for the U.S. where there is the added complication of\ndiffusion of pay TV. The U.K. is free from this complication as pay TV is still extremely rare and monthly price and attendance figures are available until their publication ceased in May 1985. In this note we use a demand equation to discuss what ticket sales would have been in the period (January 1983 onwards) when video access began to gather impetus. Comparison of the equation results with actual ticket sales suggests a marked reduction which may tentatively be attributed to the VCR.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00220047\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/247395246_The_impact_of_video_recorders_on_cinema_attendance\n|Reference=Spraos (1962); Cameron (1986);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Comparison of the equation results with actual ticket sales suggests a marked reduction which may tentatively be attributed to the VCR.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Brattle Groupe paper prepared for the US National Research Council, available at: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063398.pdf.\n|Abstract=Copyright law can theoretically create property rights but whether digitization and the internet have eliminated the ability of producers to receive adequate compensation for their work under the current system of rights is now a fundamental social and economic question. This paper addresses that question by providing an economic summary of how the markets for music, film and books have changed. Our paper focuses on three industries, music, film and books, where the industry structure evolved under a long-term regime of robust copyright protection. In each industry, we first discuss the stages of the traditional supply chain.\nSecond, we discuss the effects of digitization on that traditional supply chain, focusing on how digitization has radically reduced distribution costs, while simultaneously increasing the potential for piracy of content. Third, we provide a brief history of how new business models for the distribution of content in each industry have fared thus far. Finally, we consider how the intermediaries and the artists are likely to fare under the\nnew regime.\n|Authentic Link=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063398.pdf\n|Link=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063398.pdf\n|Reference=Waldfogel (2011); Elberse (2010); (Knopper (2009); Vickery et al. (2005); Slater et al. (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In all three of these industries, digitization and the internet have led to a precipitous decline in distribution costs, as well as an enormous increase in piracy that has likely diminished the economic rewards afforded by copyright.\n\n* By establishing legal rights to the intellectual content of these works, copyright solves the market failures associated with these public goods. However, this approach works only if producers are able to capture adequate compensation to produce at the socially desirable level. \n\n* If a copyright scheme fails to create enforceable ownership rights, producers of intellectual works will not receive adequate compensation for their initial investment and will therefore face reduced production incentives. This is the situation that digital distribution threatens to create.\n\n* Unless addressed through novel business models, the resultant market failure could require legal innovation (perhaps in the form of compulsory blanket licenses) to ensure that producers have adequate incentive to create original works. \n\n* Each of the three main functions of record companies—finding talent, recording music, and promoting/distributing songs—has been affected by digitization and internet distribution.\n\n* Digitization has had its greatest impact in the post-theatrical release segment of the film industry, which has been dominated by physical DVDs for the past 8 to 10 years. Online distribution of digitized movies has been possible since 1997. Nevertheless, revenues from online distribution have been relatively modest for the past five years due to both low sales volumes and relatively lower prices for online content. \n\n* Online distribution is becoming increasingly important to the industry at the same time that TVs are increasingly integrated with internet connectivity.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Museums and rightholders should cooperate to ensure that they get a fair return in the subsequent exploitation of the artwork by third party operators.\n\n. Museums should also negotiate with the various stakeholders and in particular with academics, artists and collective management organisations to update licenses and tariffs, to ease the acquisition of permissions and to anticipate new uses that may need authorisation. Joint action of museums would enhance their negotiation position and help draw a blue print where the lawmakers may not have set applicable rules or even figured out the stakes. Statements of the museums community on thumbnail images could provide some guidance, more will be needed with digital humanities and 3D printing as well as with crowdfunding.\n\n3. Cooperation between museums should be encouraged and those more experienced could provide useful guidance to fellow museums through the aegis of ICOM and project partnerships.\n\nRecommendations to the lawmakers\n\n1. Digitization of collections appears to be an inescapable step to fulfill their primary mandates of preservation and communication to the public for information on heritage resources to be visited.\nIn this respect, rules on digitization of artwork held in the permanent collection of a museum, whether or not orphan works, for preservation purposes, could be clarified and harmonized as exceptions or limitations. Digitization of unpublished works could follow the same rule as for orphan works, e.g. prior due diligence to locate rightholders and seek consent and disclosure only for legitimate reasons of public interest. Consultation on museums’ websites (with restricted downloading) of the permanent collections, catalogues and archives could also be addressed as a limitation subject to the rightholder‘s consent and standard compensation.\n\n2. The territoriality of rights and the difficulty associated with clearing rights in different territories is a long-enduring situation, which copyright collective management entities know well. They have indeed entered into reciprocal agreements with sister organisations to ease the licensing of copyright. Still there is no overall licensing framework for international exhibitions and the scope of the required authorisations for digital transmissions is not all that clear: differentiating acts of reproduction and communication to the public is not easy. Furthermore, “communication to the public/ making available” is not explicitly defined in content, location and effect, notably regarding spin off effects on image search services which operate to some extent like image banks and the implications of hyperlinking towards copyrighted works.\n\n3. Education, research and study are often collaborative and cross-border activities. There are Creative Common licenses for these purposes which museums can use for dissemination of their own copyrighted works. Yet, museums should develop their own policy to ensure the terms of a communication of their collections for research and study in accordance with their strategy, the requirement of non-commercial purposes and the development of text and data mining for instance. A minimum set of principles could be retained by ICOM or a group of museums willing to address this challenge.\n|Description of Data=The 45 member countries with statutory exceptions for museums were analyzed.

Available at SSRN 2099876\n|Abstract=Copyright has an innovation problem. Judicial decisions, private enforcement, and public dialogue ignore innovation and overemphasize the harms of copyright infringement. Just to pick one example, “piracy,” “theft,” and “rogue websites” were the focus of debate in connection with the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). But such a debate ignores the effect of copyright law and enforcement on innovation. Even though innovation is the most important factor in economic growth, it is difficult to observe, especially in comparison to copyright infringement.\n\nThis article addresses this problem. It presents the results of a groundbreaking study of 31 CEOs, company founders, and vice-presidents from technology companies, the recording industry, and venture capital firms. Based on in-depth interviews, the article offers original insights on the relationship between copyright law and innovation. It also analyzes the behavior of the record labels when confronted with the digital music revolution. And it traces innovators’ and investors’ reactions to the district court’s injunction in the case involving peer-to-peer (p2p) service Napster.\n\nThe Napster ruling presents an ideal setting for a natural experiment. As the first decision to enjoin a p2p service, it presents a crucial data point from which we can trace effects on innovation and investment. This article concludes that the Napster decision reduced innovation and that it led to a venture capital “wasteland.” The article also explains why the record labels reacted so sluggishly to the distribution of digital music. It points to retailers, lawyers, bonuses, and (consistent with the “Innovator’s Dilemma”) an emphasis on the short term and preservation of existing business models.\nThe article also steps back to look at copyright litigation more generally. It demonstrates the debilitating effects of lawsuits and statutory damages. It gives numerous examples, in the innovators’ own words, of the effects of personal liability. It traces the possibilities of what we have lost from the Napster decision and from copyright litigation generally. And it points to losses to innovation, venture capital, markets, licensing, and the “magic” of music.\nThe story of innovation in digital music is a fascinating one that has been ignored for too long. This article aims to fill this gap, ensuring that innovation plays a role in today’s copyright debates.\n|Authentic Link=http://wisconsinlawreview.org/wp-content/files/2-Carrier.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2099876\n|Reference=Evangelista (2000); Collins (2002); Jayasuriya et al.

Journal of Communication Inquiry, 33(3), 206-221.\n|Abstract=This study explores file sharers’ reported motivations for downloading and uploading content on peer-to-peer networks, including ethical obligations guiding file sharing. Drawing on Lessig’s classification of purposes of file sharing and Giesler’s theoretical framework of gifting systems, 40 in-depth interviews were conducted with file sharers in Singapore using a standard protocol, then transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Downloading is perceived as an alternative through which users satisfy desires that existing markets do not meet. Respondents reported downloading to avoid long waits for content to arrive in Singapore; to access difficult-to-find and censored content; to sample content, including content outside their usual tastes; and because downloading is convenient and free. Respondents reported a norm of reciprocity and sense of community that motivated them to upload and an obligation to purchase content they liked. Implications for understanding and combating file sharing during the inevitable transition to other business models are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://jci.sagepub.com/content/33/3/206.abstract\n|Reference=Giesler & Pohlmann, 2003; Lessig, 2004; Madden & Rainie, 2005; Chua, 2007a; Pfanner, 2008;\n|Plain Text Proposition=* To regard file sharers as homogeneously unethical and criminal is oversimplified.\n* Findings suggest that P2P downloading is being used in arguably positive ways to fulfill fole sharers' needs that the content industries have not met.\n* Downloading motivations included reasons such as: (1) seeking access to content that is difficult to find; (2) downloading to avoid long waiting times; (3) to sample entertainment content in order to determine what to buy; (4) the convenience and cost considerations of quickly downloading music; and (5) in order to buy the content after downloading if they liked the work (33 of 40 reported doing this).\n* Uploading motivations included: (1) a norm of reciprocity to give back to the community of file sharers; and (2) a sense of virtual community based on sharing and common tastes. Fear of legal risks dissuaded some people from sharing. \n* File sharers turn to downloading to satisfy desires the current commercial markets inadequately meet. The solution to the downloading problem should align content industries with consumer demands, i.e., paid downloads, making digital copies more available to satisfy issues with access and waiting times.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2010). Clipping Our Own Wings: Copyright and Creativity in Communication Research. American University.\n|Abstract=Communication scholars need access to copyrighted material, need to make unlicensed uses of them\nin order to do their research, and often—especially within the United States—have the legal right to\ndo so. But all too often they find themselves thwarted.\n\nA survey of communication scholars’ practices, conducted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Fair Use and\nAcademic Freedom in the International Communication Association (ICA), reveals that copyright\nignorance and misunderstanding hamper distribution of finished work, derail work in progress, and\nmost seriously, lead communication researchers simply to avoid certain kinds of research altogether.\nNearly half the respondents express a lack of confidence about their copyright knowledge in relation\nto their research. Nearly a third avoided research subjects or questions and a full fifth abandoned\nresearch already under way because of copyright concerns. In addition, many ICA members have\nfaced resistance from publishers, editors, and university administrators when seeking to include\ncopyrighted works in their research. Scholars are sometimes forced to seek copyright holders’\npermission to discuss or criticize copyrighted works. Such permission seeking puts copyright holders\nin a position to exercise veto power over the publication of research, especially research that deals with contemporary or popular media.\n\nThese results demonstrate that scholars in communication frequently encounter confusion, fear, and\nfrustration around the unlicensed use of copyrighted material. These problems, driven largely by\nmisinformation and gatekeeper conservatism, inhibit researchers’ ability both to conduct rigorous\nanalyses and to develop creative methodologies for the digital age.\n\nCommunication scholars can benefit by developing best practices standards for the most ample and\nflexible copyright exemption permitting unlicensed use of copyrighted materials: fair use. While nonU.S. members will not be able to apply this doctrine directly to work done outside the United States, having this interpretation established for U.S. scholars will expand opportunities within a large area of communication research, encourage international scholars to explore their own nations’ copyright exemptions, and provide an important benchmark for non-U.S. scholars looking for models as\ncopyright reform proceeds.\n|Link=http://cmsimpact.org/sites/default/files/documents/pages/ICA_-_Clipping.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=- 387 communications researchers responded to this survey, primarily from the US and Canada.\n\n- The survey indicated heavy reliance on usage of and access to copyrighted works for analyising and criticising: 18 percent for all or nearly all of research; 36 percent for some; 32 percent for a small portion; and 14 percent for none.\n\n- Other uses require regular reproduction of works in communication research, such as showing film clips in experiments.  16 percent of respondents reported using an entire copyrighted work for purposes other than analysis or critique, and they identified uses of copyrighted material as particularly important for research.\n\n- The majority of research rated their knowledge of copyright as 'good' or better but also actively seek guidance: 15 percent always seek guidance on use of copyrighted material; 24 percent usually; and 37 percent at least occasionally.  Despite these reports, researchers also felt confused about copyright intricacies and fearful use of certain materials could impede work.  \n\n- Thus 31 percent have abandoned a project entirely due to infringement concerns.  Over half of respondents would 'somewhat likely, very likely, or definitely' undertake a different course of research if copyright were not a concern.\n\n- Despite formalities for copyrighted material, many of the uses of copyrighted material that researchers avoided would have been considered as possible fair use, at least under U.S. law.\n\n- Non-U.S. scholars reported similarly about copyright inhibiting research; however, they were less confident about knowledge of copyright exceptions, were more likely to have received warnings from home institutions about using copyrighted materials, and were more likely to be pursuing a different course of research were it not for copyright infringement concerns.\n|FundamentalIssue=3.

University of Cambridge\n|Abstract=The aim of this study is to provide the Gowers Review with an independent assessment of the economic evidence bearing on proposals to extend the term of copyright in sound recordings. The issue raised before the Review is whether the term of copyright in sound recordings in the UK (and implicitly this would require an alteration at EU level) should be increased.\n|Authentic Link=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/gowers_cipilreport.pdf\n|Link=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/gowers_cipilreport.pdf\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Rob and Waldfolgel (2004); Brooks (2005); PwC (2006); Heald (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Benefits consist of welfare from new works created because of higher levels of expected revenue under the longer term. Costs consist of the increased deadweight losses stemming from restricted access to existing and future work due to the extension.\n\n* Investment in current artists should be based upon the prospects of profits, not the availability of past ones. Therefore retrospective term increases will have no effect upon the creation of new work.\n\n* Extension will increase the net present value of revenues for new works by 1% or less. While some authors argue that this small increase might, in some circumstances, result in a disproportionate reaction, nothing in the empirical evidence suggests that this is the case as regards current levels of production in the record industry.\n\n* Given the small size of this increase, the large number of works already being produced and the likely size of the deadweight loss (particularly in relation to historical works) it is our view that a term extension will likely result in a net loss to UK society as a whole.\n\n* Increasing copyright term increases revenues to the record industry. For retrospective extensions the 2% increase in the present value of revenues (being approximately 160 million pounds) suggested by PwC would seem plausible while for prospective extensions the figure would likely be 1% or lower. \n\n* Existing literature gives little indication as to how revenues would be distributed however our research did indicate that featured recording artists would likely benefit to some extent from such an extension with typical royalties rates around 5–15%.\n\n* Existing economic theory plausibly suggests that the extension of copyright term increases costs to consumers (consumers should be construed in a wide sense to include all users of recorded music including bars, film-makers, broadcasters etc). While the immediate cost of prospective extension is likely to be small, the immediate cost of an extension applied to existing works would likely be significant.\n\n* Increasing copyright term in the UK from 50 to 70 (or 95 years) is likely to have a significant, negative effect, on balance of trade.\n\n* The theoretical arguments that some incentive is required to induce publication, archiving and preservation activities in relation to old works seem to us to be plausible. However the review does not find that the need for such incentives would justify giving existing copyright holders an extended term of protection in the original work.\n\n* Modern systems of law regard the protection of established rights as fundamental. That is, once granted, modern legal systems rarely reduce existing entitlements. The effect of the principle of respect for established rights is that it is much easier to extend copyright term than to reduce it (so much so that term extensions are likely to be \'irreversible\'). \n\n* If term were not extended and research over the next ten years showed this lack of extension to have been a mistake then it would be relatively easy to correct this error by introducing a term extension.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Thus, the case for an extension would have to be especially compelling to make it preferable to keeping term at its current length.

An Empirical Investigation of Computer Users in China European Journal of Information Systems, 20, 659-673.\n|Abstract=This study empirically examines Chinese computer users’ ethical ideology and its relationship to their software piracy attitude and behaviour. The investigation reveals several important findings. First, cluster analysis results show that Chinese computer users can be divided into four ethical ideology types(i.e., situationists, absolutists, subjectivists, and exceptionists) reasonably consistent with Forsyth’s taxonomy. Second, when compared with situationists, absolutists, and exceptionists, subjectivists are found to have the least unfavourable attitude towards software piracy and are most frequently engaged in software piracy. Third, Chinese computer users’ ideological relativism exerts a stronger influence on their software piracy attitude and behaviour than does their ideological idealism. The findings suggest that the government, and authentic software developers and vendors should focus on subjectivists as their target audience of anti-software piracy communications.

Yet, despite this importance, there is very little work on the topic in the \neconomics literature. In this paper, we consider the effect of incentives on creativity. We present\na first series of experiments on individual creativity where subjects face creativity tasks where, in \none case, ex-ante goals and constraints are imposed on their answers, and in the other case no \nrestrictions apply. The effects of financial incentives in stimulating creativity in both types of \ntasks is then tested, together with the impact of personal features like risk and ambiguity \naversion. Our findings show that, in general, financial incentives affect “closed” (constrained)\ncreativity, but do not facilitate “open” (unconstrained) creativity. However, in the latter case \nincentives do play a role for ambiguity-averse agents, who tend to be significantly less creative \nand seem to need extrinsic motivation to exert effort in a task whose odds of success they don’t \nknow. The second set of experiments aims at exploring group creativity in contexts where the \n“corporate culture” is either cooperative or individualistic. Our results show that, in the case of closed tasks, financial incentives and collectivist attitudes foster creativity, but only with\ncooperative corporate culture.\n|Link=http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~charness/papers/creativity.pdf\n|Reference=Kirchkamp and Schunk (2012)\n|Plain Text Proposition=- Financial incentives only increased creative output when; individuals where motivated by financial incentive to do closed creative tasks (tasks with a known goal or end) and in a group setting where the group had a common goal (this treatment group mimicked the collective corporate culture).\n\n- In other circumstances like in open creativity tasks (no knows creative target/goal) and when no team incentive were produced for groups the monetary incentives did not increase creative output.\n\n- Also found that men where more likely to take risks than women and wagered more money under know risk (coinflip), however under ambiguous risk (the exact probabilities of were unknown to the test subjects) men and women bet similar amounts to what the women bet under known risk which would suggest men are more averse to ambiguous risk than women.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

It aims to make the framework useful in particular in the assessment of the merits of current claims for changes to the scope of exceptions. These calls for changes have recently become louder in light of technology improvements. The improvements allow for new channels of distribution and for new uses of creative work. They also reduce the cost of copying and affect transactions costs. With these changes taking place, changes in the scope of exceptions may be required.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131001-study_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131001-study_en.pdf\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Pollock (2007); Miceli and Adelstein (2006); Yoon (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*Exceptions are likely to be justified when transaction costs prevent mutually beneficial trade. In the extreme, this a case of missing markets. Some existing exceptions, like the citation exception, seem to be at least in part motivated by such considerations.  \n*In the view of technological advances, which allow for new modes of exploitation of creative works, calls for new exceptions have been made. Besides enabling new modes of exploitation and use of creative work, technological advances may also result in a reduction in transaction costs.\n*Assuming that markets for creative works exist but that the rightholders possess market power – which may result in a deadweight loss and which could potentially be curbed by broader exceptions – it cannot be at present established on the basis of the economic theory alone whether exceptions should be narrowed or broadened in response to a reduction of the cost of making copies of creative works (brought about by technological advances). Furthermore, it cannot be established at present on the basis of theory alone whether exceptions should be broadened or narrowed down as a consequence of the expansion of the consumption possibilities of creative material (again brought about by technological advances). Nevertheless, there may be a case for exceptions in particular when they allow for the development of product qualities that a copyright owner could not produce herself due to transaction costs and technological constraints. Exceptions are also more likely justified in circumstances where hold-up problem risks introducing dynamic inefficiencies (in terms of suppressing incentives to invest).\n*Externalities potentially introduce a case for exceptions.  The implementation of certain exceptions meant to solve problems due to transaction costs or externalities may run into difficulty when the dissemination and efficient access to the work requires some effort on the part of the right’s owner. It is then worth asking whether some market mechanism, or an alternative intervention cannot overcome the problems associated with externalities.\n|FundamentalIssue=1. Relationship between protection (subject matter/term/scope) and supply/economic development/growth/welfare,\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=B. Exceptions (distinguish innovation and public policy purposes; open-ended/closed list; commercial/non-commercial distinction), A. Nature and Scope of exclusive rights (hyperlinking/browsing; reproduction right),\n|Intervention-Response=* Technological advances have resulted in a reduction of the costs of authorized and unauthorized copying, a reduction of certain categories of transaction costs, and in opportunities for new uses of creative work. Against this backdrop, calls for new (broader) exceptions have been made; but suggestions that in fact fewer (narrower) exceptions are needed have been made as well. Copyright commentators, stakeholders with opposing interests, policy makers and academics have sometimes taken partial and diametrically opposing views in the debate.\n* Absent clearly identified and persistent market inefficiencies, exceptions are not likely to be warranted from an economic perspective.\n* Policy-makers should take a cautious approach when considering introducing new exceptions for such reasons: the market power of rightholders is limited by the inherent limitations in the scope (and length) of copyright protection and the availability of substitute creative work; and positive externalities may easily be exaggerated. Furthermore, with technological advances rightholders may increasingly be able to efficiently offer different, inferior versions of copyrighted work, obviating the rationale for the users to “self-produce” them. This means that the social loss due to market power, externalities, or productive inefficiencies, may not be as large as to justify the social costs of exceptions.\n* Social costs of exceptions predominantly manifest themselves in the form of reduced incentives for creative work and in the form of reduced incentives of the rightholders and distributors to provide access to existing and new work efficiently. Moreover, exceptions may stall the development of future efficient markets which technological advances may soon enable. Clearly, besides the potential benefits, the policy maker will have to consider the likelihood and the economic significance of these costs in the assessment of new exceptions.\n|Description of Data=Economic analysis of EU copyright exceptions in light of public policy.\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative data/text mining, Document Research, Qualitative content/text mining\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining), Multivariate Statistics, Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games); Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Film and motion pictures; Television programmes; Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=European Union;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=European Commission;\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2365, 'title': 'Charles River Associates (2014)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Charles River Associates (2014)\n|Author=Charles River Associates;\n|Title=Economic Analysis of the Territoriality of the Making Available Right in the EU\n|Year=2014\n|Full Citation=Charles River Associates, Economic Analysis of the Territoriality of the Making Available Right in the EU (2014).\n|Abstract=In the European Union, the protection of copyright and related rights is territorial in the sense that these rights are provided by national laws and their geographical scope is limited to the territory of the state granting them. As a result, enforcement of rights occurs\non a country-by-country-basis. With respect to online on-demand uses of their creative works, authors of music and audiovisual works as well as holders of related rights enjoy an exclusive right of making their works available online to the public “in such a way that members of the public can access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them”. In practice, online on-demand services also often involve a relevant act of reproduction of copyright protected works which entails the clearance of a second type of right, namely the reproduction right.\n\nSome stakeholders have suggested that the current copyright regime makes the clearance of rights for cross-border online uses an unnecessarily complex as well as resource-consuming process. Multinational service providers indeed often have to negotiate required rights separately for several territories since licensing content on a territory-by-territory basis (territorial licensing) appears to be a common practice in Europe. This arguably raises barriers to cross-border online access and prevents the online sphere from realising the full economic potential associated with the borderless nature of the internet.\n\nIn this report, we take territorial licensing as consisting of rightholders exercising the territorial nature of copyright by limiting the geographical scope of the rights granted to  licensee to a proper subset of EU Member States within a particular transaction. In line with this definition, the territorial nature of copyright is in itself not a sufficient condition for territorial licensing to take place. Indeed, the decisions of licensors to restrict the geographical scope of licences (i.e. to license on a territory-by-territory basis), are based on private motivations and depend on the wider institutional context, not only on the territorial nature of copyright. This report analyses the private motivations underlying the choice of territorial licensing in the current institutional framework in order, in a nutshell, to answer the following question: would a limitation to the practice of territorial licensing improve social welfare? The report focuses on two kinds of copyright-protected works, recorded music and audiovisual works.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/1403_study1_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/1403_study1_en.pdf\n|Reference=IFPI (2013); IVF (2013); Cooper et al. (2005); Chen and Waterman (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The study identifies several key mechanisms through which the proposed scenarios are likely to affect total welfare. These mechanisms can be broadly categorised into three groups: (1) the use of vertical agreements to affect the interaction between parties within the vertical supply chain and between vertical supply chains, (2) price discrimination and (3) transaction costs.\n\n* Territorial licensing, as an instance of vertical agreements, could generate efficiencies by allowing the parties in vertical relationships to control for harmful externalities. However, it could also be used anti-competitively. The scope for efficiencies would appear to be significant in the relevant industries, and potential harmful effects, while possible, do not appear to be systemic. Therefore, policy changes which reduce the effectiveness of territorial licensing entail a risk of undermining the associated efficiencies which do not appear to be justified by the possibility to reduce the risk of harm.\n\n* Regarding price discrimination, our analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to static welfare that might flow from the proposed policy changes. However, we also find that, in scenarios which limit the ability to restrict territorial scope of licences, dynamic effects would likely negatively affect total social welfare. Our analysis suggests that, due to the importance of sunk costs in both the music and the audiovisual industries and due to the short life of these products, the weight put on preserving the dynamic incentives to invest in the production of creative content should be significant. Price discrimination in the audiovisual and music industries might then well be efficient overall. \n\n* It may indeed well be that the increase in transaction costs which results from territorial fragmentation of rights is an unavoidable side-effect of efficient licensing practices. A careful examination of the determinants of transaction cost reveals, perhaps counterintuitively, that some of the analysed policy changes designed to promote multi-territorial exploitation of content might result in an increase in transaction costs in comparison to the Status Quo. This is because in some of the scenarios legal and/or business uncertainty would likely increase.\n\n* The analysis of the four hypothetical scenarios favours the introduction of the country of origin principle while preserving the freedom of contracting (Scenario 2). This scenario could indeed reduce transaction costs while preserving the ability of the stakeholders to limit the territorial scope of their licences through appropriate contractual clauses. However, such conclusion is subject to a few important caveats.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

By considering the ways social dynamics and cultural orientations guide uses of digital media technology, I argue that a legal and political focus on ‘piracy’ ignores crucial aspects of file-sharing, and is misleading in the assumptions it makes for policy.

This study aimed to fill in this gap to predict consumers’ intentions to engage in online music sharing and further consider consumers’ online music sharing knowledge as a moderator in the research model. The results of repeated measures analysis of variance of costs and utilities of online music sharing not only give more detailed information to grasp empirical implications but also provide some suggestions to the music industry in Taiwan.\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/239794223_Costs_and_Utilities_Perspective_of_Consumers%27_Intentions_to_Engage_in_Online_Music_Sharing_Consumers%27_Knowledge_Matters\n|Reference=Al-Rafee and Cronan (2006); Boldrin and Levine (2002); Hennig-Thurau, Henning and Sattler (2007); D'Astous, Colbert and Montpetit (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=There were four main hypothesis:\n# The costs that consumers perceive from online music sharing are negatively relatedto their attitudes toward online music sharing.\n# The utilities that consumers obtain from online music sharing are positively related to their attitudes toward online music sharing.\n# Consumers’ attitudes toward online music sharing are positively related to their intentions to engage in online music sharing.\n# The relationships in the three hypotheses above are moderates by the consumers’ online music-sharing knowledge. \n\n\n* The regression analysis results show that an individual’s perceived costs of online music sharing has a negative, but his or her perceived utilities of online music sharing has a positive, impact on his or her online music-sharing attitude.

Two factors, cost savings from CD purchase and the low moral reasoning ability of Internet users, have been frequently attributed as rationales for this behavior. Music download, however, can also be interpreted as a value maximizing behavior that chooses between the values from consuming illicit and legitimate music, wherein the consumption value is partly dependent on one’s degree of fashion involvement since music is fashionable. This paper presents a conceptual model of music download by looking at and integrating these seldom noticed perspectives with traditional explanations. An analysis of 834 samples drew from a survey of P2P users in Taiwan reveals that: people are maximizing value while downloading music; and that fashion involvement influences the perception of consumption value from music download. This study also found that moral reasoning moderate the relationships among fashion involvement, consumption value, and behavioral intention to download music.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422308000033\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Chen_Chen/publication/223753389_The_intention_to_download_music_files_in_a_P2P_environment_Consumption_value_fashion_and_ethical_decision_perspectives/links/0c960537e0742a07ea000000.pdf\n|Reference=Husted (2000); Chen et al.

A positive value from downloading music will facilitate music download, and a comparison of the consumption value between the two ways for getting music positively influence users’ behavioral intention.\n\n* Secondly, music download may not be perceived as a problem of ethics. The moral reasoning ability is not related with the behavioral intention to download music files. Downloading music files, though illegal, therefore is probably deemed not so unethical under the ideology of freeware.\n\n* Thirdly, fashion involvement plays an important role in shaping an individual’s intention to download. People who highly involve with fashion will download music files because this behavior is viewed as a symbol of new life style.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

To attract customers, companies should try their best to apply and realize the benefits of the new technology to increase their consumers’ value and satisfy their needs for fashion. The design of the content and meaning of CD albums should coincide with the metaphors of the latest trend and emotional needs for a sense of belonging to that trend.\nMusic companies can also try their best to improve the value of CDs, or reduce the value from download. This can be done through adjusting components of consumption value: utility or costs for these two alternatives.\n|Description of Data=A sample of 1300 was drawn, and a total of 1239 surveys were returned.

Some researchers attribute the widespread incidence of software piracy to people\'s attitudes toward piracy behavior and peer norms. However, current literature leaves unanswered a fundamental question of why individuals pirate software. The objective of this paper is to identify the underlying reasons why individuals pirate software. We also identify what motivates individuals to purchase software as opposed to pirating it. Understanding why individuals purchase and pirate software has clear value for policymakers to develop effective measures to curb the software piracy problem.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40398240\n|Reference=Zagorsky (1990); Anthes (1993); Cheng (1995); Sims, Cheng and Teegen (1996);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This research found that the three most important reasons for respondents to purchase software were "required for school work or workplace," "use the software all the time," and "availability of manual."\n\n* The three most important reasons for pirating software included "software too expensive," "want to try out software," and "can\'t afford the software." These reasons, with the affordability of software as the common thread, are used by software pirates to justify their piracy.\n\n* Software piracy is often used by software vendors as grounds for pricing the software higher in order to recoup the potential piracy losses.\n\n* The findings in this study suggest that a higher software price makes piracy more desirable and a lower software price may in fact be called for.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Information goods pricing and copyright enforcement: Welfare analysis. Information Systems Research 14.1 (2003): 107-123.\n|Abstract=We consider how the government should set the fine for copying, tax on copying medium, and subsidy on legitimate purchases, whereas a monopoly publisher sets price and spending on detection. There are two segments of potential software users—ethical users who will not copy, and unethical users who would copy if the benefit outweighs the cost. In de ciding on policy, the government must consider how the publisher adjusts price and detection to changes in the fine, tax, and subsidy. Our key welfare result is that increases in detection affect welfare more negatively than price cuts. We also show that the tax is welfare superior to the fine, and that a subsidy is optimal. Generally, government policies that focus on penalties alone will miss the social welfare optimum.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.14.1.107.14762\n|Reference=Besen and Kirby (1989); Varian (2000); Liebowitz (1982); Novos and Waldman (1984); Gopal and Sanders (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=We derived three welfare results. Our key result is that, whereas the producer of an information good may view pricing and enforcement as substitutes in its strategy, the two variables have quite different welfare implications. By reducing the expected benefit among those who copy, an increase in detection imposes greater social losses than a price cut. Accordingly, society prefers that information goods producers man age piracy through price cuts rather than enforcement.\nOur second result is that, if copying occurs, then a tax on the copying medium is welfare superior to a fine on individuals who are detected to have made copies. The tax has less effect on the legitimate price and encourages the publisher to reduce spending on detection. Our final result is that it is optimal to sub sidize legitimate purchases. Besides stimulating usage, the subsidy leads the publisher to reduce spending on detection. Generally, then, our analysis suggests that policies focusing on penalties alone while ignoring taxes and subsidies would miss the social welfare optimum.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Determinants of Music Copyright Violations on the University Campus. Journal of Cultural Economics, 31(3), 187-204.\n|Abstract=The protection of copyrights in the music industry has been of paramount concern as the popularity of digital music players, personal websites, and filesharing continues to grow, each of which subsequently contributes to the persistence of Internet music piracy. While the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) links filesharing to copyright piracy, others argue that filesharing allows maximum exposure of artists’ music which in turn increases its value. While this debate continues, little empirical research has specifically addressed the behavioral aspects of the consumer. In this paper, we use survey data on university students to study how attitudes toward copyright law along with economic and demographic factors affect the extent of music copyright violations. We find that while students are responsive to economic incentives and perceptions of risk, the extent of these incentives has not reversed the overall propensity to engage in filesharing.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10824-007-9042-y/fulltext.html\n|Reference=Peitz and Waelbroeck (2003); Gayer and Shy (2005); Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004); Rafael and Waldfogel (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study evaluates music consumption and file-sharing habits of university students as well as their attitudes towards music piracy.  Results amongst students indicate cost as a major factor to students, whose behaviour is influenced by heightened risk and lowered cost.  The article concludes that, so long as attractive (competitively priced and compatible with students’ willingness to pay) and flexible (e.g., single song purchase as opposed to entire album), students will opt for copyright compliant alternatives to file-sharing.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This study developed and empirically tested a model examining the antecedents of consumer attitude and behavioral intention toward music piracy behavior. Two types of music piracy behavior, unauthorized duplication/download and pirated music product purchasing, were examined. Based on a field survey in Taiwan, the results showed that attributive satisfaction, perceived prosecution risk, magnitude of consequence, and social consensus are very important in influencing customers’ attitude and behavioral intention toward two types of music piracy behavior. In addition, singer/band idolization can affect the attitude and behavioral intention in the case of pirated music product purchasing. Perceived proximity was found to affect the attitude and behavioral intention in the case of pirated music product purchasing. However, it only influenced behavioral intention in the case of unauthorized duplication/download.\n|Link=http://facultynh.syr.edu/bjsheeha/Research%20Projects/music%20download%20research/music%20download%20project/articles%20for%20music%20download/antecedents%5B3%5D.pdf\n|Reference=Kwong et al., 2003; Cordell et al., 1996; Giles, 2000; McCutcheon et al., 2002;\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Piracy is the greatest threat facing the music industry worldwide today.

Yet, the key factor underlying these strategies is the ability of the media industries to influence an individual’s willingness to pay (WTP) for legal purchases when illegal versions exist. This article estimates the effects of factors influencing WTP for digital music downloads.

It argues that:\n\n* Income and risk perceptions play a dominant role in influencing WTP. It also finds that ethics strongly and positively influence WTP, which is consistent with the growing acceptance of fee-based music (e.g., iTunes).\n\n* The key variables INCOME (economic factor) and CAUGHT and PENALTY (risk factors) contribute significantly and positively to influencing students’ WTP for digital music downloads.\n\n* Male students are significantly less likely to be willing to pay for music relative to female students.\n\n* Older students are significantly more willing to pay for music, a finding that may reflect a growing maturity level as students complete their studies.\n\n* White/Caucasian and Asian/Asian- American students are more likely to acquire music using piracy methods, with the former exhibiting a stronger tendency.\n\n* Aside from the key income and risk variables, ethical considerations also are a contributing factor in a student’s decision to purchase music rather than using file-sharing methods or forgoing consumption.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Economic incentives and enforcement actions both contribute to such outcomes though it is unclear to what extent such strategies influence the willingness of individuals to pay for goods in the legal market.\n\n- Government policies and corporate strategies aimed at increasing the value of legal music downloads (by lowering prices or increasing their perceived value) and increasing perceived risk of piracy (by making illegal downloads less attractive) can have a complementary and significant impact on reducing music piracy.\n\n- Campaigns to increase awareness of the potential harmful effects of all forms of copyright piracy are shown to be effective in influencing the decisions of students when choosing the means to acquire music.\n|Description of Data=Confidential, anonymous written survey of 665 college students from two major U.S. universities, with 472 sufficiently complete for empirical inclusion (51% male, 49% female).

This study explores the effects of artist adoration and the perceived risk of being caught on the attitude and intention to engage in pirating a digital song among college students. The moderating effect of cultural environment factor is also examined. Experiments using between-group factorial designs were conducted in the United States and Taiwan. The results show that perceived risk of getting caught and cultural environment are important factors that can significantly affect the attitude and intention toward downloading unauthorized music. In addition, a two-way (Perceived Risk × Culture) and a three-way interaction in the model are also observed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508422.2011.570163\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/233240994_The_Effects_of_Artist_Adoration_and_Perceived_Risk_of_Getting_Caught_on_Attitude_and_Intention_to_Pirate_Music_in_the_United_States_and_Taiwan\n|Reference=Fiske (1992); Dimanche and Samdahl (1994); Hofstede (1983); Levin et al (2007); Lysonski and Durvasula (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This study found that the perceived risk of getting caught is one of the important factors that can significantly reduce the attitude and intention toward download unauthorized music in both the United States and Taiwan. Although Taiwanese students have a more tolerant attitude and intention to download unauthorized music than their U.S. counterparts in general, their approval of piracy and intention to engage in it will be significantly reduced if the risk of being caught is higher. This finding can provide strong insight into how to curb this form of music piracy throughout the world.\n\n*The results also demonstrate that the cultural environment does have an effect on the attitude and intention toward music piracy. Using the United States and Taiwan as the examples, this study showed that the norm of reciprocity in a collectivist culture is a motivator for music file sharing. In addition, the legal environment also exerts a role in music piracy behavior. Compared to the United States, Taiwan has less stringent Internet copyright enforcement. The low rate of being caught leaves consumers with no excuse not to share music with in-group members.\n\n* Compared to Taiwanese students, U.S. students are not sensitive to the difference between the effect of low and medium perceived risk of getting caught on their attitude toward downloading music illegally.\n\n* The effect of adoration of a specific artist on curbing individuals’ approval of downloading unauthorized music is mixed in the research results. Students in the United States have a less favorable attitude toward downloading unauthorized music of their favorite artists in the condition of low perceived risk of getting caught as opposed to other perceived risk situations.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The growing presence of unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted products inhibits full potential growth and discourages creative activity. This study analyses the extent of software copyright infringement among college students and attitudes of these students with regard to risk of apprehension and conviction. We find a significantly higher likelihood of infringement for computer majors and male students, and a decrease in the likelihood of infringement for older students. We also uncover differences in attitudes toward risk of apprehension and conviction between majors in scientific fields and those in business and economics. Whereas the first group of majors appears to exhibit risky behavior, the latter tends to be more risk averse.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/000368400110034253#.VcH5__N_Oko\n|Reference=Besen and Raskind (1991); Scotchmer (1991); Neilson and Winter (1997); Lee and Mansfield (1996); Gould and Gruben (1996);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study concerns software copyright infringement in one major group: the college student.

Although previous studies propose several antipirating strategies, they do not discuss how to enhance customer intentions to use legal software, which is crucial for software companies. The authors provide four generic retention strategies developed from both antipiracy and customer loyalty literature. The results indicate lower-pricing, legal, communication, and product strategies all enhance customer purchase intentions toward legal software. The lower-pricing strategy is more useful for stayers and dissatisfied switchers, and the communication strategy is most useful for dissatisfied switchers. Both the legal and product strategies have similar impacts on purchase intentions across the three segments. From a firm perspective, a product strategy is most worthwhile and useful across all segments.\n|Link=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CC8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%252Fs10551-007-9456-7&ei=Fz1jVdTYH8iR7AaWmIBg&usg=AFQjCNEDUXuA39lbuJlXgsC42FRlnv3wRw&bvm=bv.93990622,d.ZGU\n|Reference=Gopal et al (2004); Harvey (1987); Oliver (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The paper outlined 5 hypothesis:\n# A lower-pricing strategy has a positive impact on purchase intentions toward a company's legal software.\n# A legal strategy has a positive impact on purchase intentions toward a company's legal software.\n# A communication strategy has a positive impact on purchase intentions toward legal software.\n# A product strategy has a positive impact on purchase intentions toward legal software.\n# How all four strategies impact intentions to purchase.\n\nResults:\n* The lower-pricing strategy is more useful for stayers and dissatisfied switchers than for satisfied switchers.\n* The lower-pricing strategy is more useful for stayers and dissatisfied switchers than for satisfied switchers.\n* The legal and product strategies have similar impacts on purchase intentions across the three segments.\n* Of the four retention strategies, product strategy is the only one that provides both benefits and switching barriers.\n* The strategy to use special codes or other technologies to prevent copies seems useful for the majority of customers because they are not good at overcoming the protections, regardless of whether they are stayers, dissatisfied switchers, or satisfied switchers.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

However, digital aggregation has tested the boundaries of copyright law. It is not clear whether allowing extracts of copyrighted works to be distributed by others benefits or harms copyright holders. We ask whether digital aggregation encourages users to "skim" or to investigate content in depth. We exploit a contract dispute that led a major aggregator to remove information from a content provider. We find that after the removal, users were less likely to investigate additional content in depth. The relaxation of copyright protection benefited horizontally or vertically differentiated content the most.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1864203\n|Reference=Shapiro and Varian (1999); Sandoval (2009); Arrington (2010); Athey et al.

More specifically, it shows that: \n\n* Users do not view an aggregator as a perfect substitute for copyrighted content. When users encounter content summarized by an aggregator, they are more likely to be provoked to seek additional sources and read further rather than merely being satisfied with a summary.\n\n* Websites with either a very national or very local audience suffered the steepest decline in downstream visits after the removal of online content. Aggregation benefits content that is either vertically differentiated, such as nationally recognized sites with acclaimed standards of quality, or horizontally differentiated, such as local sites that would not otherwise find a broad audience. Aggregation of content from hyperlocal sites may encourage consumer traffic to these sites and help expand the user base.\n\n* When digital advances reduce search costs, this promotes a greater search for information rather than simply reducing the time that a person spends on a predefined set of information. Digital aggregation does benefit high quality sources and that even with the plethora of sources available in the Internet age, users still do seek sources with acclaimed standards of quality.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Academic Conferences Limited.\n|Abstract=The primary objective of this research is to identify the individual factors which influence the intention to pirate software and digital media in Thailand. An increasing of the speed of internet and the high technologies of digital compression are factors that made a digital piracy happen easily. Moreover, the lower cost of hi-speed internet is the incentive of the software and digital media piracy occurrences. This is only one of many reasons which cause digital piracy. As Thailand was ranked 13th in the most software piracy in the world in 2003, there are a lot of concerns about the high increasing of the digital piracy in Thailand. This study focuses on one of the digital piracy model, and uses The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a based theory to determine the factors influencing software and digital piracy. Attitude, Subjective norms and Perceived Behavioral Control are the factors described in TPB as they affect to the intention to create the behavior. Past Behavior is another factor added in this study apart from TPB, which has an impact to the piracy intention. The digital piracy behavior model was developed in this study, and the five hypotheses were proposed. A survey is used to collect data for testing the constructs of the research. Almost four hundred people in Thailand were asked to answer the questionnaire which was developed from an effective guideline to examine the constructs in TPB. Attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and past behavior were found significantly to be predictors of digital piracy intention. Moreover, the digital piracy intention was a greatest determinant of digital piracy behavior as described in TPB. The implication of this study is to identify the digital piracy factors which relate to people's behavior and to model the digital piracy behavior framework for better understanding of digital piracy behavior. In addition, using the result of this research, a better understanding of the cause of the piracy intention emerges. These can be used to help fighting with a software and digital media piracy in Thailand.\n|Authentic Link=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/48918362/individual-factors-impact-pirating-digital-media-thailand\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2621, 'title': 'Coase, RH', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2725, 'title': 'Christopher Buccafusco and Jonathan S Masur', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

DVD Pirating Intentions: Angels, Devils, Chancers and Receivers. Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 11(1), 1-10.\n|Abstract=Digital piracy is perceived as a considerable problem by the film industry, and numerous preventative strategies have been introduced, but so far with limited success. This paper explores DVD piracy in particular, and focuses on identifying different types of pirating behaviour and the antecedents to this behaviour. Four distinct types of ‘pirates’ were identified, based on a cross-sectional sample of UK adults. These groups were serious pirates (‘Devils’), opportunists (‘Chancers’), receivers (‘Receivers’) and non-pirates (‘Angels’). A structural equation modelling approach was used to establish the importance of key antecedents for the overall sample and the four sub groups. The base model fitted the overall sample very well as for the sub group ‘Chancers’, but as expected, there were significant differences in model fit and the importance of key variables between the different behaviour types. The construct of ‘perceived harm’ emerged as an important differentiator in all models. The results suggest that targeting anti-pirating measures specifically at different types of behaviour and their antecedents may increase the effectiveness of such measures and also assist with the efficient allocation of limited resources in this area.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cb.357/abstract\n|Reference=Nunes et al., 2004; Rayna, 2004; MPA, 2006; Waterman et al., 2007;\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Four different types of pirating behavior occur: (1) angels (22%), who are not a threat; (2) receivers (27%), who do not actively pirate themselves but do not mind passively receiving pirated content; (3) chancers (23%), who use an opportunity to and pirate when they see it, but do not engage in this behavior frequently; (4) devils (largest group at 29%), who are the most active pirates, see no harm no their behavior, and are not affected by ethical considerations. \n* Ethical considerations and crime perception do not seem to be important considerations when pirating behavioral is considered, as the relationship is only marginally significant. Most people do not view pirating as an ethical issue. \n* Perceived harm has the strongest impact on behavioral intentions, both for the overall sample and for all groups (except for the angels), and overall there is a strong perception that pirating does not cause any harm. \n* The nature of this research suggested that the attitudinal constructs are interlinked: the perception of harm caused by pirating and ethical considerations are interlinked, and with concepts of fair price, and perceived harm and perceived value are related.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

A way forward would be to develop strategies and advertising campaigns that focus on lost profits not just for the film industry but also for distributors and intermediaries and that are based on the effects of the 'small people', rather than 'big bosses' in industries concerned.\n* To raise awareness toward ethical issues, effective campaigns should emphasize realistically the serious and harmful effects of piracy, rather than focusing on 'downloading is stealing.'\n* A more promising avenue might be the cooperation between governments, industry and Internet service providers to identify, warn and possibly punish copyright offenders (exclude them from the Internet).\n|Description of Data=The study began with two subsamples: (1) 300 (18-25 year olds) students in the South Wales area of the UK; (2) 300 (varying ages) UK residents in London, Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol.

National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper No.7552.\n|Abstract=Based on a survey questionnaire administered to 1478 R&D labs in the U.S. manufacturing sector in 1994, we find that firms typically protect the profits due to invention with a range of mechanisms, including patents, secrecy, lead time advantages and the use of complementary marketing and manufacturing capabilities. Of these mechanisms, however, patents tend to be the least emphasized by firms in the majority of manufacturing industries, and secrecy and lead time tend to be emphasized most heavily. A comparison of our results with the earlier survey findings of Levin et al. (1987) suggests that patents may be relied upon somewhat more heavily by larger firms now than in the early 1980s. For the protection of product innovations, secrecy now appears to be be much more heavily employed across most industries than previously. Our results on the motives for patent indicate that firms patent for reasons that often extend beyond directly profiting from a patented innovation through either its commercialization or licensing. In addition to the prevention of copying, the most prominent motives for patenting include the prevention of rivals from patenting related inventions (i.e., "patent blocking"), the use of patents in negotiations and the prevention of suits. We find that firms commonly patent for different reasons in "discrete" product industries, such as telecommunications equipment or semiconductors. In the former, firms appear to use their patents commonly to block the development of substitute by rivals, and in the latter, firms are much more likely to use patents to force rivals into negotiations.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.nber.org/papers/w7552\n|Link=http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/smartin/courses/590/NBER7552.pdf\n|Reference=Levin et al.

As music pervades European culture and society, only music\nhas the real potential to kick-start online content services.\nThis Study examines the present structures for cross-border collective management of\ncopyright for the provision of online music services. It concludes that the absence of EU-wide\ncopyright licences for online content services makes it difficult for these music services to take\noff. Improving cross-border licensing for music services requires the creation of entirely new\nstructures for cross-border collective management of copyright.\nIn order to improve cross-border management of copyright, this Study considers three\noptions: (1) Do nothing (Option 1); (2) Suggest ways in which cross-border cooperation\nbetween national collecting societies in the 25 Member States can be improved (Option 2); or\n(3) Give right-holders the choice to authorise a collecting society of their choice to manage\ntheir works across the entire EU (Option 3).\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/management/study-collectivemgmt_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/management/study-collectivemgmt_en.pdf\n|Reference=Cap Gemini (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The Study concludes that Option 3 offers the most effective model for cross-border\nmanagement. With respect to cross-border licensing, allowing right-holders to choose a\ncollecting society outside their national territories for the EU-wide licensing of the use made\nof his works, creates a competitive environment for cross-border management of copyright\nand considerably enhances right-holders’ earning potential. With respect to cross-border\ndistribution of royalties, the right-holders freedom to choose any collecting society in the EU,\nwill be a powerful incentive for these societies to provide optimal services to all its rightholders, irrespective of their location – thereby enhancing cross-border royalty payments.\nThe Study therefore proposes a series of principles that Member States would have to adhere\nto in order not to stifle the emergence of Option 3 as a competitive model for the cross-border\nmanagement of copyright works.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The aim of the Directive was to remove existing differences in the legal protection of databases by harmonising the rules that applied to copyright protection, safeguard the investment of database makers and ensure that the legitimate interests of users to access information compiled in databases were secured.\n\nAt the time of its adoption, the Commission reasoned that differences in the standard of\n“originality” required for a database to enjoy copyright protection impeded the free movement\nof “database products” across the Community. In particular, the Commission argued that the\ndifference between the lower “sweat of the brow” copyright standard (i.e. involving\nconsiderable skill, labour or judgment in gathering together and/or checking a compilation)\nthat applied in common law Member States and the higher “intellectual creation” standard\nthat applied in droit d’auteur Member States created distortion of trade in “database\nproducts”.\n\nIn essence, the Directive sought to create a legal framework that would establish the ground\nrules for the protection of a wide variety of databases in the information age. It did so by\ngiving a high level of copyright protection to certain databases (“original” databases) and a\nnew form of “sui generis” protection to those databases which were not “original” in the sense\nof the author\'s own intellectual creation (“non-original” databases).\nThe approach chosen in the Directive was to harmonise the threshold of “originality”. Those\n“non-original” databases that did not meet the threshold would be protected by a newly\ncreated right.\n– In a first step, this was done by adopting the higher standard that applied in droit d’auteur\ncountries, which had the effect of protecting fewer databases by copyright (which was now\nlimited to so-called “original” databases);\n– In a second step, for those databases that would previously have enjoyed protection under\nthe “sweat of the brow” copyright, but no longer according to the harmonised “originality”\nstandard, a new right was created – the “sui generis” right to prevent extraction and reutilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of a database in which there\nhas been substantial investment (“non-original” databases).\n\nWhile “original” databases require an element of “intellectual creation”, “non-original”\ndatabases are protected as long as there has been “qualitatively or quantitatively a substantial\ninvestment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents” of a database.\nThe “sui generis” right is a Community creation with no precedent in any international\nconvention. No other jurisdiction makes a distinction between “original” and “non-original”\ndatabases.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/databases/evaluation_report_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/databases/evaluation_report_en.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=The economic impact of the “sui generis” right on database production is unproven. Introduced to stimulate the production of databases in Europe, the new instrument has had no proven impact on the production of databases. Data taken from the GDD (see Section 4.2.3) show that the EU database production in 2004 has fallen back to pre-Directive levels: the number of EU-based database “entries” into the GDD6 was 3095 in 2004 as compared to 3092 in 1998. In 2001, there were 4085 EU-based “entries” while in 2004 there were only 3095.\n\nIs “sui generis” protection therefore necessary for a thriving database industry? The empirical\nevidence, at this stage, casts doubts on this necessity. The European publishing industry, which was consulted in a restricted online survey, however produced strong submissions arguing that “sui generis” protection was crucial to the continued success of their activities. In addition, most respondents to the on-line survey (see Section 4.2.2) believe that the “sui generis” right has brought about legal certainty, reduced the costs associated with the protection of databases, created more business opportunities and facilitated the marketing of databases.\n\nAt this stage, the evaluation concludes that repealing the Directive altogether or repealing the\n“sui generis” right in isolation would probably lead to considerable resistance by the EU\ndatabase industry which wishes to retain “sui generis” protection for factual compilations.  However, The paper also concludes that leaving the Directive unchanged is an additional policy option for the Commission.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Improving cross-border licensing for music services requires the creation of entirely new\nstructures for cross-border collective management of copyright.\nIn order to improve cross-border management of copyright, this Study considers three\noptions: (1) Do nothing (Option 1); (2) Suggest ways in which cross-border cooperation\nbetween national collecting societies in the 25 Member States can be improved (Option 2); or\n(3) Give right-holders the choice to authorise a collecting society of their choice to manage\ntheir works across the entire EU (Option 3).\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/management/study-collectivemgmt_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/management/study-collectivemgmt_en.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=The Study concludes that Option 3 offers the most effective model for cross-border\nmanagement. With respect to cross-border licensing, allowing right-holders to choose a\ncollecting society outside their national territories for the EU-wide licensing of the use made\nof his works, creates a competitive environment for cross-border management of copyright\nand considerably enhances right-holders’ earning potential. With respect to cross-border\ndistribution of royalties, the right-holders freedom to choose any collecting society in the EU,\nwill be a powerful incentive for these societies to provide optimal services to all its rightholders, irrespective of their location – thereby enhancing cross-border royalty payments.\nThe Study therefore proposes a series of principles that Member States would have to adhere\nto in order not to stifle the emergence of Option 3 as a competitive model for the cross-border\nmanagement of copyright works.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Measuring Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.\n|Abstract=This wide-ranging review evidences a lack of appreciation among those producing research for the high-level principles of measurement and assessment of scale. To date, the approaches adopted by industry seem more designed for internal consumption and are usually contingent on particular technologies and/or sector perspectives.\nTypically, there is a lack of transparency in the methodologies and data used to form the basis of claims, making much of this an unreliable basis for policy formulation.\nThe research approaches are characterised by a number of features that can be summarised as a preference for reactive approaches that look to establish snapshots of an important issue at the time of investigation. Most studies are ad hoc in nature and on the whole we found a lack of sustained longitudinal approaches that would develop the appreciation of change. Typically the studies are designed to address specific hypotheses that might serve to support the position of the particular commissioning body.\nTo help bring some structure to this area, the paper proposes a framework for the assessment of the volume of infringement in each different area. The underlying aim is to draw out a common approach wherever possible in each area, rather than being drawn initially to the differences in each field.\n|Authentic Link=http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/13916/IP_Measuring_Infringement.pdf;jsessionid=A1B55A8258EA96F5B35B14DEBE1AFE71?sequence=2\n|Link=http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/13916/IP_Measuring_Infringement.pdf;jsessionid=A1B55A8258EA96F5B35B14DEBE1AFE71?sequence=2\n|Reference=Ofcom.

The underlying aim is to draw out a common approach wherever possible in each area, rather than being drawn initially to the differences in each field.\n- The authors advocate on-going survey tracking of the attitudes, perceptions and, where practical, behaviours of both perpetrators and claimants in IP infringement. The key element of the survey structure is the adoption of a survey sampling methodology and smaller volumes of representative participation. Once selection is given the appropriate priority, a traditional offline survey will have a part to play, but as the opportunity arises, new technological methodologies, particularly for the voluntary monitoring of online behaviour, can add additional detail to the overall assessment of the scale of activity.\n- The costs involved with this common approach could be mitigated by a syndicated approach to the survey elements. Indeed, a syndicated approach has a number of advantages in addition to cost. It could be designed to reduce any tendency either to hide inappropriate/illegal activity or alternatively exaggerate its volume to fit with the theme of the survey. It also has the scope to allow for monthly assessments of attitudes rather than being vulnerable to unmeasured seasonal impacts.\n|Description of Data=In the literature review, 28 studies regard trade marks and offline copyright infringement, 23 studies concerc online copyright infringement, 6 studies are about patent infringement, and 7 studies regard design rights infringement.\n\nThe researcher has sought 18 trade bodies’ views on IPR Infringement Research \n\n10 responses to a questionnaire have submitted by the trade bodies’ \n\n7 Research Experts’ Views on Online Measurement of IPR Infringement have been sought\n|Data Year=Not stated.

(2004). Cultures of music piracy An ethnographic comparison of the US and Japan. International Journal of Cultural Studies, 7(3), 343-363.\n|Abstract=In 2003, the US recording industry, hoping to change what some view as a ‘culture of piracy’, initiated lawsuits against its own consumers. What is this culture of piracy and what is at stake in trying to change it? In this article, I take an ethnographic look at music file-sharing, and compare the situation in the US with Japan, the second largest music market in the world. My findings are based on fieldwork in Tokyo, and surveys and discussions with US college students. By considering the ways social dynamics and cultural orientations guide uses of digital media technology, I argue that a legal and political focus on ‘piracy’ ignores crucial aspects of file-sharing, and is misleading in the assumptions it makes for policy. A focus on fan participation in media success provides an alternative perspective on how to encourage flourishing music cultures.\n|Link=http://ics.sagepub.com/content/7/3/343.short\n|Reference=Vogel (2001); Vaidhyanathan (2001); Lessig (2004); Litman (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Explores the impact of illegal downloading activity using secondary data and survey data from university students in the United States\nHighlights the difference between the way Japan and US share music as in Japan using internet data is expensive compared to the US so they share by copying on hard drives and CD's while US share more via the internet. Hence preventing online sharing does not prevent copying\nThe authors points out that declining record sales could be attributed to increases in price instead of attributing it to solely file sharing. \nWarns against draconian copyright regimes as it could hinder the competitiveness of US copyright products .\nConcludes by pointing out that file sharing is a way for consumers to spread knowledge about new music and that there is also the try before you by aspect to file sharing where consumers can test music before buying it.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Competing claims can be assessed and challenged transparently if the underlying data and methods are revealed. Robustness and limitations of findings are meticulously collected and are available here for all to see.\n\nThis project is offering a form of a dynamic literature review in a rapidly changing technological, business and socio-legal landscape, as the evidence related to copyright is consistently and transparently updated to account for the most recent findings. Only very recently, new research methods in combination with the development of big data, which are richer both in size and in depth, have allowed researchers to test empirically [[:Category:Fundamental Issues|key theoretical propositions]] and forced them to build theories which are consistent with observation. This generated the need to evaluate political decisions and design [[:Category:Evidence Based Policies|policy interventions based on evidence]]. \n\nThis open online platform builds on an innovative research philosophy and examines copyright from an interdisciplinary perspective, while it also facilitates bringing evidence to the debate from studies in fields that were previously overlooked. Relevant empirical work spreads across conventional [[:Category:Methods|methodological]] and [[:Category:Disciplines|disciplinary]] boundaries and it does not need to have "copyright" in the title.\n \nA crucial dimension of the existing evidence examines different stages of production (e.g. creation, innovation, diffusion, distribution), in various creative industries (e.g. [[Sound recording and music publishing|music]], [[Film and motion pictures|film and motion pictures]], [[Television programmes|TV programmes]], [[Software publishing (including video games)|computer software]], [[Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing|books]]), and estimates the effects of copyright on diverse agents in each sector, such as creators, investors, distributors, users or society as a whole. Heterogeneity seems to be a key common element across several studies. The fact that the impact of copyright law differs across various agents, industries and different demographic groups, implies the need for more specific policies (for instance, even though the [[Ofcom_(2011)|Ofcom (2011)]] survey provides evidence for heterogeneous effects, this remains an understudied aspect in most of the existing studies).\n \nThe transition to a global digital economy is associated with new challenges for enforcement authorities, for copyright law and for new business models. Imaginative use of the increasing volume of data is crucial for the design of more rational policies at the national and international level. Importantly, the effects of copyright protection or infringement on welfare, creativity and innovation demand the theories that developed over the past decades to be consistent with rigorous empirical analysis.\n\n\n== I.

In UK legislation such provisions are referred to as ‘permitted acts’ (Chapter 3, Part I CDPA 1988). The international standard is the three-step-test set out in the Berne Convention: the permitted acts must apply to ‘certain special cases’, must not ‘conflict with a normal exploitation of the work’ and not ‘unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author’ (Berne Convention Art 9(2)). Whereas US copyright law provides for a general principle of ‘fair use’ (17 U.S.C. para.107), European Union legislation provides an exhaustive list of specific exceptions (Art 5 Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC); the implementation of one exception, (concerning certain ‘transient or incidental’ acts of reproduction) is compulsory, but others are optional. The UK has always provided for ‘permitted acts’ through specific provisions (as opposed to the broader principle of ‘fair use’ in US law), including ‘fair dealing’ in relation to criticism or review of a work, research or private study. In recent years, the UK has included further specific ‘permitted acts’ within the parameters of Art 5 Information Society Directive, for instance data mining and parody. The full list can be found at Part I, Chapter 3 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988. \n<div class="mw-collapsible-content">\n\nThere is a significant body of work by legal scholars exploring the rationale for imposing limits to the rights of the copyright owner. Amongst other things, the literature has explored the relation between these legal provisions and (i) the public interest, (ii) innovation, and (iii) market failure (as proposed by Kretschmer, 2014). For example, an exception which enables the use of orphan works (those works where the copyright owner is unknown or impossible to locate) could be justified under (i) as providing greater access to shared cultural heritage for social purposes. An orphan works exception could also be justified in terms of innovation under (ii) as unlocking expressions for new creativity, which would otherwise be undeveloped, or under (iii) because the costs in locating and asking permission from unknown rightsholders are high enough that they make it impossible to contract. Similarly, the UK debate of a private copying exception in 2014,  justified it on all three grounds as (i) providing consumer benefit and convenience, bringing everyday practice into alignment with copyright statues, (ii) encouraging innovation by enabling intermediary services and (iii) addressing market failure by enabling a practice which takes place in the private sphere beyond the ability to contract. The exception was challenged according to justification (iii) with opponents arguing that it did not address market failure without an accompanying levy in place on writable media such as iPods and blank CDs.  Other European jurisdictions use consumer levies to raise funds which are used to compensate rightsholders for private copying which takes place beyond their control. The argument that such copying could be priced-in and thus reflected in the initial price of creative goods was challenged in the UK. and a need for better evidence identified (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors v Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills EWHC 1723 (Admin) (19 June 2015). https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/basca-v-sofs-bis-judgment.pdf\n\n\n\'\'Policy interventions\'\'\n\nPolicy concerns arise, for instance, from balancing the three justifications noted in the previous section, such as (i) the need to balance the public interest with other legal restrictions which may override the effectiveness of exceptions, such as end-user license agreements, contracts and DRM systems (see Favale, 2011; Hargreaves, 2012; Kretschmer et al, 2010); (ii) whether exceptions are compatible with broader political and economic objectives such as pursuit of a digital single market in the EU or new innovative digital practices (see Erickson et al, 2013; Mendis, 2013); and (iii) whether exceptions or private contracting would improve economic welfare, for example in choosing between a non-commercial exception for user-generated content or relying on proliferating use of automated private licensing (Heald et al, 2015; Karaganis & Urban, 2015). Some legal theorists and practitioners have proposed more radical changes to EU copyright law, questioning whether principles such as fair use or minimum standard user rights would be more appropriate legislative tools to promote innovation while remaining technologically agnostic (Dobusch & Quack, 2013). \n\n\n\'\'Existing evidence\'\'\n\nFollowing the Gowers review of Intellectual Property in 2006 and leading up to the implementation of the Hargreaves review in 2014, a significant amount of data were gathered from industry, consumer and policy representatives in the UK context.  These qualitative and anecdotal accounts nevertheless form a corpus which builds understanding of the various views and political stakes in the debates around copyright reform and exceptions (see Edwards et al, 2015; Erickson, 2014). Additional empirical data about the anticipated consumer welfare and economic impact of new copyright exceptions were collected and analysed as part of both review exercises (see for example the IPO impact assessments on Quotation and Parody).  [LINK]\n\nScholarly research on exceptions consists of policy reports and peer-reviewed articles. Reports by Favale et al (2013) on the proposed orphan works licensing scheme and work by Erickson et al (2013) on the impact of the proposed Parody exception are indicative of evidence gathered and used in the policy process itself. Both of these studies adopt a mixed socio-legal/economics approach which explores the appropriate balance of rights and consumer interests in the context of incentivising new production and use of copyright works.  In Canada, research by the CPCC (2008) on consumer music download behavior was used to argue for collection of a levy on format shifting of music content to digital devices, showing that format shifting behavior was a widespread practice.  Canada adopted a levy-free digital format shifting exception in 2012. \n\n\n\'\'Evidence needed\'\'\n\nIn order to evaluate and assess the implementation of new copyright exceptions, there are ongoing opportunities for researchers to provide evidence on the impact of changes to copyright in the form of specific exceptions, prior to and following their introduction. In the context of the UK, there is evaluative potential in the wake of the Hargreaves reforms of 2014. Research should verify whether there has been, for example, a measureable impact on audience or licensing revenue as a result of the UK parody exception. Comparative research and/or natural experimental methods are naturally suited to addressing these gaps for other national contexts.\n\nIn the case of newly proposed exceptions or potential reforms, additional empirical evidence is needed to assess and consider each of the justifications of copyright exceptions.  For example, while legal-theoretical justifications exist for promoting the public interest through exceptions (i), there is less empirical evidence on the impact of exceptions on metrics of public interest such as participation, access, uptake, and knowledge dissemination. Where possible, qualitative assessments should be supplemented with quantitative sociological research in these areas. This research is of utmost importance to balance economic concerns which already form the main pillar of national policy evaluations. There is further empirical legal studies research to be done on the precise relationship between copyright statutes and creative enterprise. For example, who is using fair dealing exceptions and why? What are the impediments to relying on fair dealing exceptions for those who would create new expressions? What will be the status of different national exceptions if Europe moves toward a Digital Single Market? What should be the guiding principles for weighing the public interest in future policy determinations involving technology and the market?\n\nA great deal of research has been carried out by management scholars and economists on the relationship between intellectual property and the ability of firms to appropriate value from innovation (Teece, 1986; von Hippel and von Krogh, 2003). However, a smaller proportion of this research has dealt directly with copyright, and even fewer studies have addressed copyright exceptions (for one example, see Haefliger et al, 2010). Further research is needed to assess the impact of newly proposed exceptions, as well as their scope, on innovation-based justifications (ii). For example, the status of override-by-contract on copyright exceptions is important because it re-balances the scales between platform operators, users, and rightsholders, with potential implications for innovation. Empirical research is needed to assess whether the gains in innovation enjoyed by users due to exceptions can offset potential harm to rightsholders or losses of control suffered by platform operators.  \n\nEconomic welfare calculations are central to policy decision-making around changes to copyright, as evidenced by the data used to evaluate the Hargreaves reforms. Economic approaches have been the most commonly applied methodological tools to assess copyright and they continue to be useful (Landes & Posner, 1989; Scotchmer, 2007; Waldfogel, 2014). The status of copyright exceptions requires further clarification in policy, which can be aided by rigorous empirical analysis. In order to further address policy concern about the status of exceptions in markets characterised by contracting and/or technological protection measures (TPMs), research must be conducted to establish (i) whether and how best to assert the primacy of exceptions and (ii) the anticipated economic impact of any proposed policy changes in terms of both industry growth and consumer welfare. \n\nThe issue of user-generated content is at the forefront of policy reform initiatives, with some groups calling for a broad ‘right to remix’ on one end of the spectrum, and industry support for commercial licensing alternatives on the other. Copyright exceptions are directly implicated in this debate, because they legally define what users can fairly do with a copyright work (such as quoting or parodying it).  Fair use and fair dealing principles are challenged by expansion of automated notice and takedown procedures that have become widespread on certain online content platforms.  Empirical work is needed urgently on the ability of notice and takedown procedures to take into account fair use and fair dealing in online settings, so that clear policy recommendations can be made to improve the way that user-generated content is regulated. \n\nThe principle of fair use has been extensively analysed in empirical legal studies literature in the USA, with a large body of research covering many different consumer practices in many settings (See Cheliotis (2007); Netanel (2011); Aufderheide and Sinnreich, 2015).  Somewhat less work has been done on the practical usage of specific copyright exceptions in Europe. There is therefore an open question about whether the ‘closed list’ approach adopted by Europe is the most effective way to balance public interest with copyright holders’ interests.  While such expansive questions are perhaps best left to legal theorists, there are practical empirical concerns that are worth answering in the European context:  How can the public interest best be served without prejudicing the rights of creators? What is the most effective way of promoting new innovation and how should copyright law respond to the challenges introduced by new technologies and new creative practices?\n\n\n\'\'References\'\'\n\nDobusch, L., & Quack, S.

This makes it feasible for cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) to digitise their physical collections (Borghi & Karapapa, 2013; Nelson & Irwin, 2014). For example, the Bibliothèque nationale de France has announced plans to digitise 500,000 works contained in its collection with national government support (Delorme, 2011). In partnership with a number of national libraries, search engine company Google initiated a project in 2004 to digitise some 20 million books at an estimated cost of $30 USD per book (Samuelson, 2009). Supporters of mass digitisation have advanced a number of justifications for these efforts, including the need to promote competitiveness in the digital economy (Hargreaves, 2012), to fulfil the mandate of cultural institutions to curate and preserve the national cultural memory (Covey, 2005), and to promote cross-cultural exchange and mutual understanding through access to information (Borghi & Karapapa, 2013). The economic and cultural justifications for digitisation often overlap, for example in the European Commission’s stated aim to pursue a cross-territory universal digital library while at the same time closing a perceived ‘knowledge gap’ with the USA (European Commission, 2011).\n<div class="mw-collapsible-content">\n\nA major impediment to mass digitisation of cultural works has been copyright law. While the technical costs of digitisation have decreased, the cost imposed on CHIs by the need to locate and ask permission of rightsholders have risen as a proportion of the cost of digitisation (Covey, 2005). This is particularly the case when CHIs seek to digitise entire collections of works, because there is often a significant number of items with rightsholders who cannot be identified or located, even after a diligent search. These materials have been referred to as ‘orphan works’ owing to their status as likely being inside of copyright protection but without known rights owners from whom to ask permission for use (Borghi & Karapapa, 2013). Investment in mass digitisation could be hindered by the high transaction costs of searching for and locating rightsholders, and by the inability to locate some rightsholders which may prevent digitisation entirely of some portion of a collection.\n\n\n\'\'Policy interventions\'\'\n\nThe European Commission’s Impact Assessment on the Cross-Border Online Access to Orphan Works (2011) identified 6 potential policy interventions, several of which were based on existing legal approaches undertaken in certain national jurisdictions. These were:\n\n1) Do nothing: without a legislative solution to the problem of orphan works, CHIs and other users in Europe would proceed under the existing copyright framework in their national jurisdictions. Digitisation of works in the public domain, or works in copyright where permission was obtained, could proceed. CHIs could independently adopt a ‘risk-based’ approach to digitisation of orphan works (See Stobo et al, 2013). The Commission’s Impact Assessment predicted that innovative ground would be lost to other territories, in particular the USA, where the fair use ruling in the Google Books court case permitted the search engine operator to proceed with digitisation under an ‘opt-out’ arrangement.\n\n2) Statutory exception for libraries: this proposal would create an exception to copyright for libraries to provide online access to works determined to be orphans following a diligent search. Legal guidelines would define the requirements for an adequately ‘diligent’ search, however no central authority would monitor the diligence of searches. In the case of re-emergence of a rightsholder, libraries could still be liable for copyright infringement if the search was found not found to be adequately diligent in order to benefit from the exception.\n\n3) Extended collective licensing: by granting collecting societies the ability to issue licenses for works not held in their repertoires, European Union Member States could make it possible for CHIs to obtain licensed use of orphan works in mediums where there is a relevant collecting society. This model is already used by libraries in Norway, where a fixed fee per digitised page is paid annually to an author’s collecting society. The authors of the Impact Assessment expressed concern that license fees could be high or equivalent to licenses for commercial works, leading to a failure to solve the ‘orphan works paradox’. This paradox arises from the lack of interest in licensing orphans due to their low commercial appeal. Also, without a diligent search requirement, CHIs in other jurisdictions would not be able to benefit from recognition of the legal status of the work, and would be required to negotiate separately with collecting societies, increasing transaction costs.\n\n4) Orphan works-specific license for libraries: in this option, the orphaned status of a work would be established via diligent search in the country of first publication and then a license would be obtained from a collecting society with authority in the relevant medium. Legal certainty would thus be achieved whilst eliminating the need for duplicated searches by CHIs in other national jurisdictions. This would permit the establishment of cross-territory digital libraries, but would introduce two sources of costs for libraries: the diligent search cost which would be required to establish legal status, in addition to any fees paid to the licensing society.\n\n5) Centrally granted national license for orphan works: in this model, which is currently used in Canada and the UK, a central national authority grants licenses to users of orphan works. Under the UK Orphan Works Licensing Scheme (OWLS) the Intellectual Property Office administers licensing of works determined to be orphan through an application procedure, for both commercial and non-commercial use, with licenses lasting for 7 years, and the management of fees paid by commercial users to compensate rightsholders in the event of re-emergence. The European Commission Impact Assessment expressed concern that such national licensing schemes hinder cross-territory digital libraries by fragmenting the legal definition of orphan status and diligent search requirement among national jurisdictions. \n\n6) Mutual recognition of orphan works made available by libraries: this policy option would create a legal framework on the definition of orphan works recognised across European Member States. After meeting the requirement of a diligent search in the country of first publication (with diligent search guidelines mandated at the European level and harmonised in national jurisdictions), institutions could digitally make available orphan works held in their collections. Mutual recognition of orphan status between territories would reduce duplication or search and expand collaboration. This option offers less legal certainty than a license; in the case of emergence of a rightsholder a user could still be liable for copyright infringement if the search was found to lack sufficient diligence to benefit from the exception.  \n\nThe EU Directive on Orphan Works (2012/28/EU) was introduced on 29th October 2014. It closely follows the mutual recognition of orphan works option (6) outlined in the Impact Assessment, with a central repository for diligent search records established at the Office for the Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM), now the European Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The UK adopted its own orphan works licensing scheme in October 2014, which exists in addition to the non-commercial exception created by Directive 2012/28/EU.\n\n\n\'\'Existing evidence\'\'\n\nA significant number of empirical studies have assessed the costs of rights clearance for CHIs and estimated the proportion of orphan works contained in collections. For example, a study by Covey (2005) conducted at Carnegie Mellon university examined  277 randomly selected book titles held in the university library and recorded the costs of rights clearance. For 19% of the books in the sample, a rightsholder could not be located. Of the 81% of titles where a rightsholder was located, 34% did not respond to the requests for permission. A further 37% of rightsholders denied permission to digitize the work, while 30% of those contacted agreed to digitisation. Calculating transaction costs (labour and material costs of searching for rightsholders not including agreed fees) the researchers estimated $200 USD per cleared work.\n\nA similar study by Stratton (2011) recorded information on the cost of locating rightsholders in a sample of 140 books published between 1870 and 2010 and held by the British Library. The study sought to identify the resource costs required to ascertain the copyright status of the material as well as the proportion of orphan works in the sample. Of the total sample, 29% of titles were found to be in the public domain due to expiration of copyright term while 71% of works were judged to be in-copyright. Of those in copyright, 43% were determined to be orphan works after a diligent search, corresponding to 31% of the total sample of 140 works. The results are in line with findings from a number other studies of library collections of 19th and 20th Century printed material (Covey, 2005; Dickson, 2010). \nStudies on other types of material have confirmed the presence of orphan works, but in different proportions depending on the nature of the collection and the medium under study. An internal study performed by the BBC and cited by both Ian Hargreaves (2011) and the UK IPO (2013) in support of a legislative solution to orphan works examined 1000 hours of factual TV programming contained in the BBC archives. The broadcaster reportedly spent 6.5 hours and £91 searching for and clearing the rights in each hour of archival programming. No indication was provided on the proportion of rightsholders that could not be located. Reporting on rights clearance costs in sound recordings, The British Library (2011) described an effort to digitise 220 analogue recordings of oral histories with jazz musicians. The recordings were originally made in the 1980s. A search for 200 rightsholders between 2005-2007 was able to successfully clear copyright permissions in 53.5% of cases. A remaining 26.5% of the collection remained orphaned, even after extensive search.  A study by Stobo et al (2016, forthcoming) on  mixed collection of scrapbook materials found a high proportion (80%) of orphan works due to the partial nature of items in the collection.  \n\n\n\'\'Evidence needed\'\'\n\nOwing to the relatively recent implementation of orphan works legislation in a number of jurisdictions, there is limited empirical evidence on the costs and benefits of policy approaches, with the exception of a small number of recently published studies. A comparative study by Favale et al (2013) evaluated the commercial and non-commercial use of orphan works in seven jurisdictions with operational orphan works regulations. The study used a rights clearance simulation methodology to ascertain and compare the license fees for a set number of uses of orphan works, finding wide divergence in costs from one jurisdiction to another. A similar study by Stobo et al. (2016, forthcoming) carried out a rights clearance simulation exercise on a sample of mixed-media works contained in the Edwin Morgan scrapbooks at the University of Glasgow Library. The study recorded costs of complying with both the national UK IPO licensing scheme as well as the diligent search requirements of EU Directive 2012/28/EU. The study found that high licensing fees and transaction costs introduced by the diligent search requirements in these schemes limited the effectiveness of the policies for promoting mass digitisation.\n\nDue to its focus on tabulating the costs of rights clearance and the size of the orphan works problem, much existing empirical work remains descriptive. Some of this work has begun to explore causal effects, showing potential for more sophisticated statistical research to draw inferences from new or existing datasets on orphan works. For example, Covey (2005) has suggested exploring the relationship between publication date, costs of identifying rightsholder and likelihood of a fee payment request. Akmon (2010) found a statistically significant relationship between type of rightsholder (commercial, individual, government, educational) and likelihood of a positive response once located, with commercial rightsholders more likely than others to refuse permission. In a study with the Wellcome Trust, Stobo et al (2013) approached the question of likelihood of rightsholder re-emergence, to evaluate effectiveness of risk-based strategies. In order to better assess national policy approaches to orphan works, it would be helpful to generate understanding about the welfare effects of these policies, considering transaction costs introduced by diligent search requirements and other formal procedures, costs to rightsholders and their ability to seek redress, and economic and social benefits of creation of digital collections. More optimal license fee structures and diligent search requirements are likely possible (for example in order to encourage mass digitisation) even within existing orphan works regulations.\n\n\n\'\'References\'\'\n\nAkmon, D.

Copyright enforcement influences the quantity and quality of new products, the volume of sales, innovation, creativity and ultimately welfare. The existing empirical literature focuses on some of these factors in isolation. However, practice, policy and research suggest that the evidence on the overall impact of copyright enforcement is far from being conclusive.\n<div class="mw-collapsible-content">\n\nThe existing theories and legal traditions emphasize the importance of different aspects of enforcement, such as the detection, deterrence, rehabilitation, and punishment of criminals and infringers. According to Weatherall et al. (2009) the literature has focused on very broad copyright issues, such as intellectual property (IP) rights as a whole, and on very narrow cases where court judgements have been made, leaving the interesting area in between unexplored. Hall et al. (2014) examine this overlooked region by contrasting formal and informal IP. They reveal that costly litigation practices in several occasions tend to encourage secrecy over patents. An interlinked crucial but challenging feature of law enforcement relates to prevention and its association with awareness, education and technology. Unambiguously, technological progress has boosted the volume of piracy but it has also facilitated the prevention of unauthorised copying, through takedowns of infringing websites, for instance. In particular, this type of technological enforcement has become increasingly important over the past decade.\n\n\n\'\'Policy interventions\'\'\n\nRecent policy interventions focus mainly on measuring unlawful behaviour and quantifying infringement, separating copyright infringements from copyright criminal offenses, distinguishing commercial from non-commercial use, calculating intermediary liability, enhancing education, digital literacy and awareness, comparing different enforcement practices, such as demand- and supply-side sanctions, graduated responses, sites blocking, mediation versus litigation and court proceeding, among others. \n\nCopyright policy interventions are concentrated on both consumption and production. Demand-side sanctions target individual subscribers via graduated response letter warnings, slowing down Internet speed for infringers (throttling back), termination of access, fines and imprisonment. Supply-side sanctions, on the other hand, focus on infringing companies via blocking sites, targeting intermediaries (follow the money approach), legal action, and increasing consumers’ awareness with clean sites lists, among others. Different countries follow different approaches. In continental Europe enforcement is undertaken mainly by agencies of the state, whereas in Anglo-Saxon countries they work jointly with private actors (see IPO, 2015). \n\nA major policy challenge relates to intermediary liability. The extent to which communications platforms, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook or open Wi-Fi administrators, are liable for their users’ behaviour remains a hotly debatable subject, while its association with innovation, freedom of expression and aggressive online activity, renders this issue as a key concern for enforcement. Among other interventions governments attempt to receive assistance from intermediaries for the implementation of copyright law. The introduction of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) in the US and the 2000 Electronic Commerce Directive in the EU, which implemented treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), focus precisely on intermediary liability and criminalise both the dissemination of protected material without permission and the circumvention of copyright controls in response to notices and takedowns. \n\nIn the presence of infringement and when copyright exceptions do not apply, enforcement can be imposed in different forms. When infringement is detected and the rights holders choose action instead of inaction, an important distinction relates to the type of action and in particular to the option between judgement and settlement. Settlement and resolution of the matter with infringers directly can save time and money before starting court proceeding – this includes Alternative Dispute Resolutions (ADR), such as arbitrations and mediations. If, however, such efforts are unsuccessful, litigation through the court system might be a more efficient but also a costlier and lengthier way to resolve the dispute. \n\n\n\'\'Existing evidence\'\'\n\nRecent evidence suggests that the transition to a global digital economy is associated with new challenges for enforcement. Online user behaviour and copyright infringement take new forms, as, for instance, physical activity becomes digital in an increasing pace, posing additional threats to the implementation of copyright law. Criminal IP offenses (also known as counterfeiting or piracy), which are often connected with organised crime, manufacture, distribution and commercial sale, have changed dramatically too, as technological progress simplified the production of unauthorised copies and digitization widened the market considerably. \n\nThe appropriate scope of copyright protection is a matter of debate (see Exceptions) To what extent non-commercial activities should come within the ambit of enforcement requires particular attention. Importantly, non-profit organisations, such as universities or the education sector as a whole, may engage in activities which are considered to be commercial, thus falling under the same copyright rules as commercial enterprises. There is a tension between the generation of income pursued by these organisations, and the (desirable) promotion of education, scientific knowledge and innovation. At the same time it raises distributional deliberations regarding the access to education and the equality of opportunity, as different institutions, which typically educate students from certain socioeconomic backgrounds, might have dissimilar capacities to stay within copyright law. The accessibility of resources through open data and open access publishing remains one of the most topical issues about copyright enforcement and its relation to knowledge, science and innovation (see Frosio, 2014).\n\nShifting attention to distinctively commercial activities and in particular to the music industry Liebowitz (2014) shows that global recorded music sales decreased by 50% in the ten years after the introduction of Napster in 1999, while before that they were on an upward trend. In response to this during the past decade there have been several antipiracy policy interventions, while researchers have evaluated the effectiveness for only a small subset of them. Among the demand side antipiracy legislations are HADOPI and IPRED, both of which have been passed in 2009 in France and in Sweden, respectively. The former has been implemented via graduate responses and has been evaluated by Danaher et al. (2014), who provide evidence of a 25% increase in legal sales after the introduction of HADOPI for France, while there is no such effect in other countries with a similar pre-policy sales trend. Adermon and Liang (2014) find comparable results for IPRED, which increased post-policy sales by 36% and decreased piracy by 32% in Sweden, relative to Norway and Finland. Two of the main supply side interventions are the shutdown of the Megaupload and the UK site blocking, both of which have been implemented in 2012. The main difference between the two policies is that the former is a worldwide intervention, while the latter is restricted in the UK only. Danaher et al. (2015) suggest that global interventions, such as the Megaupload are more effective than national policies, such as the UK site blocking, which focus on a particular country or geographic region. \n\nThe Hargreaves (2011) report commissioned by the UK government, which is in harmony with earlier recommendations by the Gower’s review (2006), focuses on evidence related to enforcement and emphasizes: i) the need for market transactions to be faster, more automated and cheaper, in order to establish a UK digital copyright market which facilitates the resolution of disputes without costly litigation, ii) the demand for easier cross-border licensing in the EU. The report also acknowledges that small and medium size enterprises should have easier access at a lower cost to the court system and recommends the establishment of a small claims track for copyright to better resolve the many lower-value IP disputes emergencing from self-employed professionals and relatively small firms.\n\nCopyright enforcement is associated with large pecuniary costs from approximately £0.8m per year in Italy and £2.5m in the UK, to £5.6m in France and £12.7m per year in South Korea (see IPO, 2015). However, the evidence on copyright and economic activity is still inconclusive, perplexing the role of enforcement. For instance, Rob and Waldfogel (2006) and Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007), among others, suggest that there is no evidence that music or file downloading harms either the volume of sales or the quality of goods produced. According to Waldfogel (2012) an explanation might be that the digitization of the music industry brought not only piracy but also large reductions in the costs related to the production, distribution, and promotion of music, while it has also widened the market. This piece of evidence raises further considerations about copyright policy, the associated cost of enforcement and its welfare implications. \n\n\n\'\'Evidence needed\'\' \n\nBoth the probability of being caught and the sanctions vary, even across comparable jurisdictions offering researchers a unique source of variation and allowing them to establish causal links between enforcement and other key variables of interest, such as sales, innovation and welfare. However, a common weakness in the existing literature and a key methodological challenge for future research is the inability to construct a convincingly appropriate control group to compare the results between treated and untreated countries. Several studies argue that they select two comparable countries, one of which implements an enforcement policy (treatment group), while the other does not (control group), and they evaluate the impact of the policy by contrasting variables of interest before and after the adoption of the intervention. Yet, there is generically a degree of arbitrariness associated with the selection of the reference or control country. One way to deal with such issues is the formation of a synthetic control group, which by construction deals with the appropriateness of the control group (a synthetic control group is comprised of different countries, which jointly form a group that is directly comparable to the treated country). Surprisingly enough, none of the existing studies on copyright follows this approach. \n\nAdditionally, in the digital age enforcement in one jurisdiction is likely to generate global spillover effects through the Internet. In the UK, for instance, IP crimes can be fined with up to £50,000 and lead to custodial sentence of up to 10 years (CDPA, 1988), while in other countries sanctions might be less or more severe. This disparity influences incentives and forces piracy to be organised in particular areas, while the derivative products can be easily distributed widely across the world. \n\nThere is some evidence from a small minority of countries on the effectiveness of different enforcement practices. For instance, stakeholders suggest that graduated response letters are relatively successful. As far as supply-side sanctions are concerned, evidence shows that making it easier, quicker and cheaper for rights holders to act against infringers is effective but also challenging. A key policy concern relates to the reflexes of enforcement authorities in response to changing technology, behaviour and legislation, as well as to the fact that so far reactions have been mainly therapeutic rather than preventive. \n\nDespite the significant progress made by some groups of researchers, such as the OHIM infringement observatory projects and the Ofcom/Kantar/IPO infringement tracker surveys, we still lack rigorous evidence and data related to copyright and users’ behaviour. In particular, there is an increasing demand for more data and evidence, from more countries and the use of new research methods for the design of future policies. Importantly, evidence-based policies require the identification of causal effects for particular policies and the examination of both direct and indirect welfare implications, as copyright enforcement is linked to innovation, privacy, civil liberties and freedom of speech, among others, which perplexes further the evaluation of policy effectiveness. \n\n\n\'\'References\'\'\n\nAdermon, A., & Liang, C.

This used a review technique from the medical sciences to identify more than 50,000 academic sources that were potentially relevant for assessing unlawful file sharing, covering music, film, television, video games, software and books. During the review process, the sources were narrowed down to 206 articles which examined human behaviour.\n#[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalbrowse&journal_id=1649836 Working papers and pre-prints published in the SSRN e-journal Intellectual Property: Empirical Studies] (edited by Christopher J. Buccafusco and David L. Schwartz). 710 papers published between November 1996 and July 2015 were narrowed down to 132 studies relevant to copyright law. These were further reviewed by the core editorial team of the Wiki (Koutmeridis, Erickson, Kretschmer) if they contained “sufficient empirical material” that warranted coding. “Sufficient empirical material” could be quantitative or qualitative. Our working definition excluded anecdotal or journalistic treatment, though single case studies were acceptable if the methodology was articulated and justified. A total of 103 studies were selected and catalogued from this SSRN source.\n#Expert literature reviews conducted by Handke (2011), Kretschmer (2012) and Kheria (2013). They were used to fill some of the gaps left by the “piracy” review, in particular relating to creator perspectives. A total of 81 studies will be catalogued under this method.\n#50 governmental reports on intellectual property/copyright policy, proposed by CREATe doctoral candidates Kenny Barr and Megan Blakely, and reviewed by the core editorial team of the Wiki (Koutmeridis, Erickson, Kretschmer).\n\nThe initial selection of studies was pragmatic. The aim was to set a standard of review, and allocate limited resources for coding. The Wiki format is designed to enable user participation, and any gaps in the evidence should be filled by interested parties who may submit studies as candidates for coding, and/or volunteer to code these according to the template developed by the team.\n\nAn editorial review process will be devised that will be open, yet robust enough to prevent capturing of the Wiki platform by any specific interests. For this purpose, an editorial board will be constituted, following the public launch of the Wiki, on 2 September 2015, as part of the 10th Annual Conference of the European Policy for Intellectual Property Association (EPIP 2015).\n\nThe text which appears in the main page has been commissioned and reviewed by the editorial team.

The determinants of such piracy as embedded in a large matrix of acquisition-mode decision factors relevant to exchange theory, including economic, legal, ethical, network and consumer behavior aspects, are investigated here. This matrix depicts numerous interrelated factors and makes assessing the decision-making process regarding music piracy more contextual than previously considered. A study of 204 American business students was conducted to test this matrix and assess the impact of the various factors. Implications and future research regarding this decision-making matrix and exchange theory are provided. The significant factors predict whether an exchange takes place between music consumers and the music industry.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296308001070\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ching_Hsuan_Yeh/publication/257103177_What_drives_purchase_intention_in_the_context_of_online_content_services_The_moderating_role_of_ethical_self-efficacy_for_online_piracy/links/0c96053acb3816aec6000000.pdf\n|Reference=Houston and Gassenheimer (1987); Madden and Lenhart (2003); Huang (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article shows that: \n\n*male respondents, younger respondents, and respondents with less household income were more likely to intend to pirate music.\n\n*It also shows that respondents who had pirated in the past, who indicated an increase in the amount of music they were downloading legally, and whose level of music purchase had decreased, were more likely to intend to pirate music.\n\n*Ultimately, People who do not consider piracy to be an important ethical or legal issue, who distinguished between different kinds of music piracy when considering the ethicality of piracy, who believed consumers, musicians, and record labels benefited from music piracy, and who perceive little risk in engaging in music piracy, were more likely to indicate an intention to pirate music.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Texas Law Review, 92(7).\n|Abstract=One of the most important ways to measure the impact of copyright law is through empirical examination of actual copyright infringement cases. Yet scholars have universally overlooked this rich source of data. This study fills that gap through a comprehensive empirical analysis of copyright infringement litigation, examining the pleadings, motions, and dockets from more than nine hundred copyright lawsuits filed from 2005 through 2008. The data we collect allow us to examine a wide variety of copyright issues, such as the rate of settlements versus judgments; the incidence of litigation between major media companies, small firms, and individuals; the kinds of industries and works involved in litigation; the nature of the alleged infringement; the success rates of particular parties and claims; and the nature of remedies sought and awarded. We also analyze the data to identify ways in which copyright litigation differs from other civil suits and to show that certain plaintiff characteristics are more predictive of success.\n|Link=http://www.texaslrev.com/copyrights-topography-an-empirical-study-of-copyright-litigation/\n|Reference=Beebe (2008); Netanel (2011); Sag (2012); Oliar and Matich (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- Geography does matter - Central District of California and Southern District of New York are 'hot spots' for copyright cases\n- Copyright cases are no more likely to be contentious than other civil litigation, but they can become very contentious\n- SMEs and 'low IP' industries are prominent and successful litigants\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=F.

Factors that influence the intention to pirate software and media. Journal of Business Ethics, 78(4), 527-545.\n|Abstract=This study focuses on one of the newer forms of software piracy, known as digital piracy, and uses the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework to attempt to determine factors that influence digital piracy (the illegal copying/downloading of copyrighted software and media files). This study examines factors, which could determine an individual’s intention to pirate digital material (software, media, etc.). Past piracy behavior and moral obligation, in addition to the prevailing theories of behavior (Theory of Planned Behavior), were studied to determine the influence on digital piracy intention. Based on the results of this study, planned behavioral factors in addition to past piracy behavior and moral obligation were found to influence an individual’s intention to pirate digital material. Attitude, past piracy behavior, perceived behavior control, and moral obligation explained 71 percent of the intention to pirate variance. Using these results, a better understanding of why individuals pirate is presented and can be used to help combat digital piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/article/10.1007/s10551-007-9366-8\n|Link=http://philpapers.org/rec/CROFTI\n|Reference=Hunt and Vitell (1986); Bhattacharjee, Gopal, Lertwachara and Marsden (2006b); Sundararajan (2004); Wagner and Sanders (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Using the components of attitude, perceived behavioral control, moral obligation, and past piracy behavior to structure this model, the study found that:\n\n*Past piracy behavior had the greatest effect on the intention to pirate. This suggests that subjects who have previously pirated digital material have a higher intention to pirate in the future, especially as the frequency of pirating increases. 76.5% of the subjects in this study have previously pirated. \n\n*The differences between males and females subjects with respect to past piracy behavior is noted. Of those who have not pirated digital material, 36.4% were men and 63.6% were women. Of those who have pirated digital material in the past, 65.1% were men and 34.9% were women. \n\n*Moral obligation also had a large effect on the intention to pirate digital material. Subjects who felt more guilt or moral obligation toward digital piracy have a lower intention to pirate. 50.7% of the subjects felt more guilt or moral obligation that pirating was not right, while 23.6% felt pirating was alright and acceptable behavior. \n\n*When comparing men and women, both groups felt that pirating was not right (54% and 46.5%, respectively).\n\n*Perceived behavioral control (PBC) also had an effect on the intention to pirate. Subjects who have the skills and resources to pirate digital media have a higher intention of pirate digital media. 84.3% of the subjects reported that it was easy or very easy to pirate digital media, and only 0.3% found it hard or very hard to pirate. In response to this high PBC, it is also interesting to note that the music and movie industries have been making pirating much more difficult to accomplish.\n\n*Attitude was not the best predictor of intention in terms of explained variance (as was the case in previous studies). This could be a result of the high correlation between attitude and moral obligation (r = 0.6481). \n\n*43.9% of the subjects indicated a more favorable attitude toward digital piracy, while 23.6% had a less favorable attitude and 32.5% neutral. \n\n*It is also noted that subjective norms was not significant in the extended TPB piracy intention model.\n|FundamentalIssue=5. Understanding consumption/use (e.g. determinants of unlawful behaviour; user-generated content; social media),\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=F. Enforcement (quantifying infringement; criminal sanctions; intermediary liability; graduated response; litigation and court data; commercial/non-commercial distinction; education and awareness),\n|Discipline=D03: Behavioral Microeconomics • Underlying Principles\n|Intervention-Response=Potential policy implications: \n\n*Given that subjects believed that it was very easy to pirate digital material, as indicated by the PBC score, one method of prevention could be new technologies such as Digital Rights Management (DRM), which are already being implemented by many companies to control the distribution and use of their digital material (Sundararajan, 2004).\n\n*The subjects in this study also believed that they had the resources necessary to pirate digital material. CD burners are available at very reasonable prices and blank CDs are even cheaper than computer floppy disks. One option is to increase the cost/supply of these resources needed for piracy. By increasing the cost of piracy and decreasing the cost of the digital material, digital piracy can be combated effectively.\n\n*Since students have access to high-speed internet at their universities, a complete Hollywood movie can be downloaded in less than 30 minutes. Many universities are now employing high-end firewalls to prevent the illegal trading of digital media. The next step would be to target ISPs and software makers (that create these file-swapping programs) to curb digital piracy.\n\n*Many subjects didn’t feel a great deal of guilt about pirating digital media; that it was acceptable behavior. There was a low level of guilt (moral obligation) towards digital piracy. To combat this, society has to be informed of how harmful piracy is. One method is the use of targeted ads like the ones targeting smoking in young teenagers. \n\n*Another method is the use of advertisements in movie theatres explaining how piracy affects the motion picture industry as well as individuals that are a part of the industry. Different harmful aspects of piracy should be presented to consumers in the public opinion court. Examples of appropriate behavior must be emphasized. \n\n*Another way would be to enforce newer ethical codes of conduct for information systems professional that stress different types of piracy (not just software) and its effect on business and society as a whole.\n|Description of Data=The  sample  for  this  study  is  based  on  a  student sample from a business college at a university in the Midwest. The  instrument  was  administered  to  a  total  of eleven  (11)  classes  during  regular  class  time  (one sophomore  class,  seven  (7)  junior  classes,  two  (2) senior classes, and one graduate class). 280 usable responses were received. A review of the sample indicates that 164 (58.6%) of which were male students and 116 (41.4%) were female students. The average age for the students in the sample was 23.5 years with an average GPA of 3.1.

Thus, of the 188 countries, 32 have no library exception in their domestic copyright statutes. These basic statistics suggest strongly that exceptions for libraries and archives are fundamental to the structure of copyright law throughout the world, and that the exceptions play an important role in facilitating library services and serving the social objectives of copyright law. The most common subject matter of the statutes is making copies (usually single copies) of works for readers, researchers, and other library users, and making copies for preservation of materials in the collections. Almost as frequently, countries have enacted statutes authorizing libraries to make copies for replacement of works that have suffered damage or loss.\n\nThese three topics long have been a mainstay of library exceptions, but recent years have brought revisions that reflect changing needs and new technologies. Most significantly, the European Union adopted a 2001 directive that authorized member countries to make digitized copies of works available to users on the premises of the library for research and study. That provision has been adopted in many of the European countries, and analogous statutes have been made a part of domestic law in countries beyond the E.U. On the other hand, relatively few countries have enacted truly distinctive law that breaks from various trends in lawmaking to address newly emerging problem areas at the border between copyright and digital technologies. Among the countries that have enacted extensive and original statutes in recent years are Canada, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile few countries have enacted comparable major changes, at any given time many countries are either revising their library exceptions or adopting entirely new copyright acts. Indeed, Mauritius and Seychelles adopted wholly new copyright acts in 2014. Revisions of selected copyright statutes have occurred during just the last several months in numerous European countries and in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore. Research on worldwide copyright developments is a dynamic pursuit.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_29/sccr_29_3.pdf\n|Link=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_29/sccr_29_3.pdf\n|Reference=Crews (2014); Crews (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Main results of the study are presented in comparative chart form.\n\n* Copyright statutes also reflect the tension that can exist among a country’s competing objectives. The details of the library exceptions reveal much about the relationship of copyright law to library services. They also can manifest a compromise among cultural, historical, and economic objectives, typically by permitting libraries to make socially beneficial uses of copyrighted works, while setting limits and conditions aimed at protecting the interests of copyright owners, publishers, and other rightsholders. This report offers the raw data of statutes that can allow for a deeper understanding of the objectives and alternatives for developing even more effective law in the future.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Evidence from the theory of planned behaviour. Journal of Consumer Policy, 28(3), 289-310.\n|Abstract=This article presents the results of an experiment in which three different types of anti-piracy arguments were tested among 139 young adult consumers susceptible to engage in swapping music over the Internet: (1) stressing the negative personal consequences of pirating music, (2) stressing the negative consequences for the artists, and (3) stressing the unethical nature of this behaviour. The psychological determinants of music piracy behaviour were modeled in part with (1991) Ajzen’s theory of planned behaviour. The results show that the intention to swap music on-line depended on one’s attitude toward music piracy, one’s perception that important others want that this behaviour be performed, and one’s perceived competency in doing so. In addition, having swapped music on-line in the past had a strong influence on one’s intention to do it again. Contrary to expectations, the anti-piracy arguments had no significant impact on the behavioural dynamics underlying on-line music piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10603-005-8489-5\n|Reference=Fishbein  and Ajzen (1975); Ajzen (1991); Ajzen (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The framework presented in the article adds two variables to the original theory of planned behavior (Ajzen,2002), i.e., past behaviour and ethical predispositions, as well as some mediating effects, and it argues that: \n\n*The decision to engage in the illegal action of swapping music is founded on one’s attitude toward music piracy, one’s perception that important others want him or her to do so, and one’s perceived capabilities to actually perform this behaviour. \n\n*Having swapped music in the past appears to exert a strong influence on one’s intention to do it again.\n\n*The more a person thinks that music piracy is a normal, habitual behaviour, the more favourable his or her attitude toward this behaviour, and the greater the likelihood of engaging again in this behaviour.\n\n*This article also shows that the arguments that anti-piracy advocates use to convince consumers not to engage in this behaviour may not be as effective as some would think.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

D., & Telang, R. (2010). Converting pirates without cannibalizing purchasers: the impact of digital distribution on physical sales and internet piracy. Marketing science, 29(6), 1138-1151.\n|Abstract=The availability of digital channels for media distribution has raised several important questions for marketers, notably whether digital distribution channels will cannibalize physical sales and whether legitimate digital distribution channels will dissuade consumers from using (illegitimate) digital piracy channels. We address these two questions using the removal of NBC content from Apple’s iTunes store in December 2007, and its restoration in September 2008, as natural shocks to the supply of legitimate digital content, and analyzing its impact on demand through BitTorrent piracy channels and the Amazon.com DVD store. \n\nTo do this we collect two large datasets from Mininova and Amazon.com documenting levels of piracy and DVD sales for both NBC and other major networks’ content around these events. We analyze this data in a difference-in-difference model and find that NBC’s decision to remove its content from iTunes in December 2007 is causally associated with an 11.2% increase in the demand for pirated content. This is roughly equivalent to an increase of 49,000 downloads a day for NBC\'s content and is approximately twice as large as the total legal purchases on iTunes for the same content in the period preceding the removal. We also find evidence of a smaller, and statistically insignificant, decrease in piracy for the same content when it was restored to the iTunes store in September 2008. Finally, we see no change in demand for NBC’s DVD content at Amazon.com associated with NBC’s closing or reopening of their digital distribution channel on iTunes.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0600\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1381827\n|Reference=Zentner (2005); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2007); Danaher and Waldfogel (2008); Smith and Telang (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The results of this study are:\n\n* NBC’s decision to remove its content from the iTunes music store on December 1, 2007 caused an 11.2% increase in piracy of that content over and above any change experienced by competitor networks ABC, CBS, and Fox over the same period.\n\n* This large jump in piracy (larger than the size of the iTunes market) is predicted by theory when there is a significant fixed cost to piracy but only a small (or no) variable cost. In other words, iTunes purchasers may avoid piracy because the fixed cost to learn to use BitTorrent (or the fixed moral/stigma cost of illegal behavior) makes piracy less attractive than iTunes.\n\n* When the digital sales channel is not available, these individuals turn to piracy, pay the fixed cost and, owing to the seemingly low marginal costs of additional downloads, begin to consume much more content through piracy than they had previously purchased.  \n\n* When NBC removed their archived seasons of television from iTunes, we found no significant change in the Amazon.com sales rank for NBC’s DVD sales relative to the trend that we saw for non-NBC box sets. One possible interpretation of this finding is that digital downloads and DVD’s are simply not substitutes in the short term.  \n\n*Adding a digital distribution channel would not lead to a short-term displacement in DVD box set sales. A similar interpretation is that there is a fixed cost to digital viewing of television, and once a consumer has “gone digital” she is unlikely to come back.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The focus of the study is on the 4-week period around December 1st 2007 when the content was withdrawn and the 4-week period around September 9th 2008 when the content was reinstated.     \n\nThis paper draws on two main secondary sources of data: Mininova BitTorrent tracker and Amazon Sales Rankings\n\nThe first of these is a survey of BitTorrent tracker files reported by Mininova.org as a proxy for piracy activity on the programs in the sample. \n\nThe piracy dataset contains the daily number of downloads for 5,200 unique episodes of television (corresponding to roughly 75 unique series) starting November 16, 2007. The data include the series name, season number, and episode number of each television program and the number of times that file was downloaded each day. \n\nThe study also controls for the network that owns the rights to the show, the genre of the show, and whether it is a series that is still producing new episodes (such as Heroes) or a “catalog” series (such as the original Star Trek). \n\nThis dataset was created from a larger dataset collected by monitoring all trackers posted to Mininova at the torrent level starting in November 2007, obtaining roughly 210,000 records per day and yielding dataset of over 68 million observations for 180,000\ntorrents. \n\nThe study also analyses piracy for television programming from the other major television networks — ABC, CBS, and Fox — as a control.\n\nThe second source of data is Amazon DVD sales rankings.

The Journal of Industrial Economics, 62(3), 541-553.\n|Abstract=Digital piracy is seen as a significant problem for the creative industries. Still, while there have been many academic studies showing that piracy hurts sales, there have been far fewer studies analyzing the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures in reversing this effect. This study attempts to address this question by analyzing how the HADOPI “three strikes” law in France affected digital music sales on the iTunes music store. To do this, we obtained a panel of iTunes sales data from the four major music labels (Universal\nMusic, Warner Music, EMI Music and Sony Music) across a broad set of countries. We then applied a difference-in-difference approach, using sales trends in a control group of European countries to simulate the counterfactual of what music sales in France would have been if HADOPI had not been passed. Our results suggest that increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group. In terms of robustness, we find that these sales changes are similar for each of the four major music labels, suggesting that our results are not peculiar to any particular label. We also find that the observed sales increase is much larger in genres that, prior to HADOPI, experienced high piracy levels (e.g., Rap and Hip Hop) than for less pirated genres (e.g., Christian music, classical, and jazz). This strengthens the causal interpretation of our results since if HADOPI is causing pirates to become legitimate purchases, its effects should be stronger for heavily pirated music than it is for other music genres.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989240\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Zentner (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Danaher, Dhanasobhon, Smith and Telang (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The mains results of this study are:\n\n* The authors state that the results suggest that the HADOPI law (and the education and media attention surrounding it) increased iTunes single sales by 90,000 units per week on average. Assuming an average song price of €1 per song, this equates to an increase of €4.7 million ($6.3 million) in annual iTunes track revenues.\n\n* Results suggest that HADOPI causally increased French digital albums sales by an average of 11,200 units per week. Assuming an average of €8.5 per album, this equates to an increase of €4.9 million ($6.7 million) in annual iTunes album sales due to HADOPI.\n\n* Together, our estimates suggest that HADOPI increased annual iTunes revenues (tracks plus albums) by about €9.6 million ($13 million) per year for the four majors combined.\n\n* Under the assumption that the four majors make up 70% of the industry, if sales for the remaining 30% of artists experienced the same change in sales as we observe for the major labels, then the impact of HADOPI was to increase overall digital iTunes sales by €13.8 million ($18.6 million) per year for the entire music industry.\n\n* The effect of HADOPI was larger for more heavily pirated genres like Rap and smaller for less pirated genres like Christian music or Jazz, which is what one would expect if the increase in sales were causally related to HADOPI.\n\n* Increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group.\n\n* The study occurs before anyone received a third notice (i.e. before any cases have been referred to the criminal court), and the increase in sales is observed even before the law’s final passage. While this may seem irrational, it is consistent with the idea that increasing the salience of the law, the illegality of piracy, and the potential penalties is sufficient to change user behavior.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Likewise, our results may inform industry practice in some countries, like the United States, that have seen the voluntary agreement between the music industry and Internet Service Providers on the application of a graduated response system."\n\n"Additionally, other industries may benefit from HADOPI. For example, to the degree that the motion picture and publishing industries suffer losses caused by filesharing, HADOPI may positively impact revenues in those industries. The study does not quantify the entire effect of HADOPI on producer surplus in the media industries, but indicates that for one industry (music) in one channel (iTunes), the law appears to have had a large and statistically significant effect."\n|Description of Data=The main data set for this study is weekly iTunes sales units for a number of European countries including France. The data extend from July 2008 to May 2011, and observe separately both track unit sales and album unit sales. The data were obtained directly from the four major music labels — EMI, Sony, Universal, and Warner — and aggregated to reflect total iTunes sales for the majors. \n\nThe study looks at the five European countries (other than France) with the highest iTunes sales levels as our control group for France, under the theory that overall market trends would have the most similar impact on countries with closer sales levels. This study observes weekly iTunes sales units for France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Belgium. This yields 918 country-by-week observations of total iTunes sales units, broken down into albums and tracks.\n\nTo measure awareness of the new HADOPI law, the study collected Google Trends data on Google searches (from France) for the search term “HADOPI.”13 Google Trends reports the “relative search index” for a search term in a given country, meaning that for each week we observe the number of searches for that term relative to the average number of all searches in that country across each week in the date range. So, for example, if there were an average of 20,000 searches per week in our date range for the term HADOPI, then in a week where there were 100,000 searches, the Google Trends index would report “5.0” for that week. Thus, while we do not know the actual volume of searches, we know when awareness of HADOPI peaked as measured by Google searches, and the relative height of that peak. This can serve as a measure of national awareness of the law. \n\nThe authors thank four major record labels for providing data to support this research.

(2012). Reel Piracy: The Effect of Online Film Piracy on International Box Office Sales. Available at SSRN 1986299.\n|Abstract=Hollywood films are generally released first in the United States and then later abroad, with some variation in lags across films and countries. With the growth in movie piracy since the appearance of BitTorrent in 2003, films have become available through illegal piracy immediately after release in the US, while they are not available for legal viewing abroad until their foreign premieres in each country. We make use of this variation in international release lags to ask whether longer lags – which facilitate more local pre-release piracy – depress theatrical box office receipts, particularly after the widespread adoption of BitTorrent. We find that longer release windows are associated with decreased box office returns, even after controlling for film and country fixed effects. This relationship is much stronger in contexts where piracy is more prevalent: after BitTorrent’s adoption and in heavily-pirated genres. Our findings indicate that, as a lower bound, international box office returns in our sample were at least 7% lower than they would have been in the absence of pre-release piracy. By contrast, we do not see evidence of elevated sales displacement in US box office revenue following the adoption of BitTorrent, and we suggest that delayed legal availability of the content abroad may drive the losses to piracy.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1986299\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2007); Bai and Waldfogel 2010; Bounie, Bourreau and Waelbroeck (2006); De Vany and Walls (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The longer the lag between the US release and the local foreign release, the lower the local foreign box office receipts. \n* This relationship is larger after the widespread adoption of BitTorrent than before: a movie release 8 weeks after the US premiere has lower returns by about 22% in a given country in 2003-2004. This increased to nearly 40% in 2005-2006.\n* From 2003-2004, the relationship between length of release lag and box office concerns was generally consistent across all film genres. From 2005-2006, each week of lag decreases returns for science fiction and action genres by an additional 1.3% per week over any decrease for other genres. \n* The writers estimate that international box office returns in the sample were at least 7% lower than they would have been in the absence of such piracy. This was determined by using the 1.3% reduction per week as the estimate of effect of pre-release piracy on box office sales. \n* The finding that the cost of delaying a film's foreign release is increasing has a strategic implication for the movie industry. Studios already appear to be reacting to this by shrinking the average release window. Studios should continue to reduce the length of the release lag, especially for genres more heavily pirated like science fiction and action films.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

These laws are highly controversial, and similar laws have been considered in the US and England.\n|Description of Data=The data used in this study consist of the weekend box office returns for the top 10 Hollywood movies each weekend in 17 countries before and after the adoption of BitTorrent (July 2003 to July 2006).

International Journal of Industrial Organization, 33, 1-8.\n|Abstract=The growth of Internet-based piracy has led to a wide-ranging debate over how copyright policy should be enforced in the digital era. In this paper we analyze the impact of the US government\'s shutdown of a major piracy site – Megaupload.com – on digital sales and rentals of movies.\n\nExploiting cross-country variation in pre-shutdown usage of Megaupload, we find that the shutdown of Megaupload and its associated sites caused digital revenues for three major motion picture studios to increase by 6.5–8.5%. Our results suggest that some consumers will turn to legal channels when a major filesharing site is shut down, and by extension that illegal filesharing displaces digital movie sales.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718713001288\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2229349\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Zentner (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Liebowitz (2008); Danaher, Smith, Telang and Chen (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are: \n\n* Before the shutdown of Megaupload, the variation in Megaupload usage across countries is random with respect to the modeled time trend of digital movie purchases.\n\n* After the shutdown, countries with higher pre-shutdown usage of Megaupload experience larger increases in digital sales and rentals than countries with lower pre-shutdown usage do. This difference is both statistically and economically significant.\n\n* The findings indicate that digital movie revenues for two studios were 6.5-8.5% higher over the 18 weeks following the shutdown (across 12 countries) than they would have been if not for the shutdown.\n\n* The shutdown of a major online piracy site can increase digital media sales, and by extension we provide evidence that Internet movie piracy displaces digital film sales and rentals.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

" Our diff-in-diff results combined with a placebo test strongly suggest that the shutdown of the popular Megaupload and Megavideo sites caused an increase in digital motion picture sales and rentals leading to an increase in digital revenues of 6.5-8.5%."\n\nHowever, the authors note that, "our study only measures specific benefits of this regulation — it does not measure either tangible or intangible costs of this sort of intervention, and such costs should be considered carefully as part of any policy decisions."\n|Description of Data=The methodology for estimating the effect of the Megaupload shutdown on sales involves crosscountry variation in the penetration level of the Megaupload cyberlocker site among Internet users. The sales data are provided by three major U.S. movie studios and include all digital purchases and rentals through their major digital channels aggregated at a weekly level from September 2, 2011 until May 31, 2012. These data include each of the 12 countries where these digital channels were available as of September 2011. The study also uses a similar dataset for a similar period from September 2012 until March 2013, in order to conduct a placebo test.\n\nInternet penetration data is based on two statistics. First, Google AdWords estimates of the total number of unique visitors, by country, to Megaupload.com and Megavideo.com during December 2011, the last full month before the shutdown. Secondly, they obtained the total number of Internet users in each country in our sample as reported by the International Telecommunications Union at the end of 2011.\nThis is used as a measure of the potential market size for digital sales in each country.\n|Data Year=2011-2013\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=3 Major Film Studios; Google AdWords; International Telecommunication Union;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Web analytic (online user trace data)\n|Method of Analysis=Correlation and Association, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Film and motion pictures;\n|Country=Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; France; Germany; Ireland; Mexico; New Zealand; Spain; United Kingdom; USA;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1807, 'title': 'Data set analysis for federal court opinions', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Method}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1820, 'title': 'Data set analysis for district court dockets/complaints filed', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Method}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2038, 'title': 'David (1993)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=David (1993)\n|Author=David, P.

(2010). Canada's' Orphan Works' Regime: Unlocatable Owners and the Copyright Board. Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal, 10(2), 215.\n|Abstract=This article analyses Canada’s approach to the problem of unlocateable copyright owners, more commonly called the problem of orphan works. Section 77 of the Copyright Act empowers the Copyright Board of Canada to issue a non-exclusive licence to an applicant whose reasonable efforts to locate a copyright owner have been unsuccessful. The article begins with a legal analysis of this statutory scheme, based on a review of every application made to the Board pursuant to s 77. These applications were catalogued into a database to facilitate detailed, empirical review and statistical analysis. This analysis lays the groundwork for comparisons among the Canadian system and approaches that already exist or are being considered in other jurisdictions, an evaluation of the underlying public policy issues, and a discussion of possible legislative or regulatory responses to the problem.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1916840\n|Reference=Gervais (2010); Carriere (1993);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Application success:\n* About half of all applications eventually resulted in the grant of a license (a decision was issued in 52.2%). Only 5 applications were formally rejected. 22.2% of applications were abandoned because the copyright owner was found, usually with the help of the Board, and often with the help of collective societies. \n\nTiming:\n* It was difficult to generalize findings on application processing times because substantive methodological hurdles could not be factored into the analysis, nor did all files proceed in the same fashion. Even so, about half (49%) of the cases took less than 8 weeks to decide; one-fifth took between 2 and 4 months; 4 decisions (2%) took more than a year. 12% of decisions were issued within 2 weeks of the application being received and just over 25% took less than 1 month. \n* There was almost no difference in the processing time required to handle applications to use artistic, literary or musical works. By contrast, applications to use architectural works were completed in about a quarter of the time.\n* The Board processed applications for non-commercial uses of works more quickly than it processed applications for commercial uses. The median number of days was 47 for non-commercial applications and 63 for commercial. \n\nNature of Applicants, Works and Proposed Uses\n* Businesses account for 37%; individuals for 31%; educators or educational institutions for 13%; government agencies for 11%; galleries and museums for 3%; community organizations for 4%; charitable groups made up the remaining 1%\n* The majority of applications were for literary and artistic works (60%).\n\nValue of Royalties\n* Total royalties paid or payable is just under C$70,000.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Estimating the effects of movie piracy on box-office revenue. Review of Industrial Organization, 30(4), 291-301.\n|Abstract=Piracy is one of the most challenging problems faced by the motion picture industry. The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that US studios lose more than $3 billion annually in box office revenue from piracy. They have launched a major effort to prevent these losses. Yet their efforts are hampered by the ex post, counterfactual, and indirect methods by which losses are usually estimated. This paper addresses these issues directly. We develop and estimate a statistical model of the effects of piracy on the box-office performance of a widely-released movie. The model discredits the argument that piracy increases sales, showing unambiguously that Internet piracy diminished the box-office revenues of a widely released motion picture. The model overcomes a major weakness of counterfactual or “but for piracy” methods widely used to estimate damages. These counterfactual methods violate the “nobody knows” principle because they forecast what the movie would have earned in the absence piracy. The model we present does not violate this basic principle of motion picture uncertainty. We estimate that pre-release and contemporaneous Internet downloads of a major studio movie accelerated its box-office revenue decline and caused the picture to lose about $40 million in revenue.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11151-007-9141-0\n|Reference=De Vany and Walls (1997); Walls (1997); De Vany and Walls (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This paper develops a model of piracy and revenue dynamics that permits early detection of piracy, directly tests the competing hypotheses regarding the effect of piracy on box office revenue dynamics, and does not violate the “nobody knows” principle. More specifically, this paper shows that:\n\n* The magnitude of the decline in weekly box-office revenues is positively related to the number of pirate download sites that are active before and during its run.\n\n* Piracy has a substantial effect on motion picture revenues.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

TDM is, according to some, a growing and very promising economic sector. Its applications seem to be full of potentialities, in a whole range of sectors, from forensic investigation, to predictive marketing and scientific research in all kinds of sectors (be they commercial or not). At the same time, in today’s world, most information becomes available in a digital format, either from its first creation or because of the growing digitization of existing print archives.\nResearch is more and more relying on data analysis techniques and, as the quantity of information grows, so does the need to be able to rely on data analysis, because computers and software will more and more have to be called upon to analyze quantities of materials which human beings will, for time and resources reasons, no more have the possibility to read and screen. Data analysis also offers the possibility to uncover new relationships between information and data which science had always been unaware of.\nFrom a legal point of view, data analysis raises various issues, one of the important one being probably privacy and personal data protection. This Study however concentrates only on intellectual property, and particularly copyright and database protection (sui generis right).\nA few countries in the world have adopted or are in the process of adopting specific copyright provisions to introduce a data analysis exception in their legislation. The purpose of this Study was to describe how data analysis fits within the present legal context in Europe (both in terms of copyright and of database protection), to highlight the issues which may constitute obstacles or difficulties when applying the existing legal texts, and to analyze whether a new exception for data analysis would be useful or necessary. The purpose was not to suggest ready-to-use provisions for a new possible directive but only to give directions and make suggestions.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/1403_study2_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/1403_study2_en.pdf\n|Reference=Borghi and Karapapa (2013); Depreeuw (2013); Walter and Von Lewinski (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=On the basis of our analysis, our suggestion is to have a new specific data analysis exception which would be inspired from, and contain partly the same conditions than, the scientific research exceptions, but which would have its own peculiarities. The suggestions are made only for TDM, not for scientific research in general.\nThe main reasons which, in our view, justify that a specific TDM exception be added to the existing legal framework have been explained in the Study and, in summary, are the following:\n- the present situation regarding the research scientific exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive and in Database Directive is not harmonized;\n- the exceptions for scientific research can be waived by contract;\n- there is a controversy as to whether the exceptions apply to “illustrate scientific research” or “for scientific research as such”;\n- the copyright exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive are limited “solely for scientific research”, which may be seen as excluding projects where, in addition to a scientific research objective, there may be other ancillary objectives;\n- the two directives impose mentioning the authors’ names and/or the sources, which may not always make sense for data analysis.\n\nThe main characteristics and contents of this new exception would be:\n- the exception would only apply where the purpose is mainly (and not “solely”) scientific research;\n- it would not just serve “to illustrate scientific research” but would apply more broadly in cases of “scientific research”;\n- it would only apply where justified by non-commercial purposes;\n- mentioning the sources or the names of the authors of the preexisting materials would not be an obligation but be left to the discretion of the researcher(s);\n- it would be an exception to the reproduction right (InfoSoc Directive and Database Directive), the adaptation right (both under the Database Direction and as part of the reproduction right in the InfoSoc Directive) and the extraction right (Database Directive);\n- it would not apply to tools designed for data analysis (which should remain untouched by the exception);\n- it would not apply if the data analysis output substitutes for the pre-existing works or databases and makes the consultation of these pre-existing elements useless;\nStudy of the legal framework of text and data mining (TDM) 117\n- it would only benefit users having a lawful access to the data;\n- it could not be overridden by contractual terms;\n- it would not be optional for Member States but would be mandatory, so as to ensure a level playing field throughout the European Union.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

It takes into account the numerous and recent important decisions taken by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and national courts since the last implementation report on the InfoSoc Directive, completed in 2007.  \nIt however does not cover all provisions of the InfoSoc Directive but only a number of topics, selected by the European Commission and listed in the Terms of Reference of this Study.  The Study therefore concentrates on two important aspects of the InfoSoc Directive with regard to its assessment in the light of digital technologies and networks:  \nRegarding exclusive rights, the "making available right" and its localisation, and some other aspects of rights related to transmissions of content in digital networks (including links to the Satellite and Cable Directive and the Rental and Lending Directive); \nRegarding exceptions, a number of key limitations and exceptions, notably in favour of: \n- libraries and archives; - research and educational purposes; - persons with a disability; - user-generated content (UGC); - press review. These selected topics should help the European Commission to assess to which extent the national copyright provisions are harmonised or not, and whether or not they form an impediment to cross-border exchange of services and information in the European Union.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131216_study_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/131216_study_en.pdf\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Method of Collection=Case Study, Document Research\n|Method of Analysis=Meta-Analysis, Legal Analysis\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=Yes\n|Funded By=European Commission;\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2490, 'title': 'David Lewis', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

(2004). Sinking the online “music pirates:” Foucault, power and deviance on the web. Journal of Computer‐Mediated Communication, 9(4), 00-00.\n|Abstract=This paper aims to evaluate power relations between corporate elites and online music file-sharers on the Web. By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. In doing so, Foucault\'s work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online “music pirates” should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers\' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them. Thus, while attempts to curb these online practices and freedoms persist, changes to a discourse guiding trading conditions between the Recording Industry and end-users have been noted, constituting a victory for the latter.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00293.x/full\n|Reference=Foucault (1977); Foucault (1982); Jordan (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article utilizes Michel Foucault’s work in order to account for the changing power relations that exist between corporate elites and online music file-sharers, by analyzing changes in discourses and practices surrounding the free exchange of music through peer-to-peer file-sharing systems. "In seeking to define and discipline emerging behavior, confrontations between discourses, some in support of the copyright holder, others aiming to defend rights of privacy, free expression and fair use, have created a mutable discursive form. In flux, these attempts to discipline online behavior also highlight the reversibility in roles played by those upholding the \'everything goes\' ethos of the Net and those seeking to impose offline norms. Corporate agents, in their strategies to limit existing behaviors, resist online discourses of freedom, likewise, consumers committed to changing trading conditions engage in creative and innovative actions to traverse the field of actions established by an offline discourse. Revolutionaries, oppressors, pirates or victims, both producers and consumers depend on each other. While the sinking of online “music pirates” or the Recording Industry is unlikely, it is possible that attempts to achieve this are helping to redefine both what can be done offline and online. More than an act of destruction, this is an act of creation."\n|FundamentalIssue=5. Understanding consumption/use (e.g. determinants of unlawful behaviour; user-generated content; social media), 4.

Kretschmer, www.copyrighthistory.org\n|Abstract=The contract between the poet John Milton and the stationer Samuel Simmons, concerning the publication of Paradise Lost, is the earliest agreement between an author and a publisher for which there exists documentary evidence. The commentary suggests that, while the terms of the contract do not necessarily reveal anything substantive about how authors in the mid-seventeenth century understood the nature of the rights they had in their manuscript work, it is nevertheless significant. Since the early eighteenth century, Milton, his work, and his contract with Simmons, were all co-opted, in a variety of ways, to service contemporary debates about the status of the author, about author- publisher relations, and about the nature of the relationship between an author and his work within the context of the emerging copyright regime.\n|Authentic Link=http://copy.law.cam.ac.uk/cam/tools/request/showRecord?id=commentary_uk_1667\n|Link=http://copy.law.cam.ac.uk/cam/tools/request/showRecord?id=commentary_uk_1667\n|Reference=Deazley (2004); Lindenbaum (1995); Rose (1993);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main propositions of the study: \n\n*The contract is the earliest agreement between an author and a publisher for which there exists documentary evidence, but it wasn\'t the first such contract ever drafted.\n\n*Whether the contract can reliably tell us anything about how authors in the mid-seventeenth century understood the nature of the rights they had in their work is open to question. \n\n*That the author had a property, the manuscript, which he might sell to a stationer, is certainly the case; that the existence of a contract about the same suggests anything as to whether an author considered he had a property right in anything other than the physical manuscript is less obvious.\n\n*The contract concerning the publication of Paradise Lost provides us with a  significant moment in the slow movement towards the realisation of the modern author. \n\n*The modest figure that Milton and his widow received from Simmons, and the penurious circumstances in which his granddaughter found herself, were used as a weapon with which authors could berate the publishing industry. \n\n*Their poverty was also co-opted in arguments concerning the author\'s relationship with his work, the nature of copyright, and the appropriate length of the copyright term.\n\n*In Areopagitica, Milton advocates the importance of the connection between an author and his work as a matter of attribution, but he nevertheless tethers the published ‘copy\' as a commodity to the stationer. In this manner, the real significance of Areopagitica in the history of copyright law lies in the way in which the work was misinterpreted and re-branded as an essay expounding the author\'s natural proprietary rights.\n\n*The use of Milton and his work to substantiate claims about the natural proprietary rights of the author, while carrying considerable rhetorical weight, may not accurately reflect Milton\'s attitudes and thoughts upon the same. \n\n*To draw upon Milton to warn against the dangers of allowing any individual to determine, on the grounds of their religious or political conviction, whether another\'s work should be published or not, is arguably a more fitting and appropriate use of the poet\'s opinions and his work.\n|FundamentalIssue=3.

Moreover, the contract provided that the print run for each of these first three editions was not to exceed 1500 copies, and also allowed Milton to require an account of sales from Simmons at reasonable intervals. In exchange for the sum of £20, Milton gave to Simmons "All that Booke, Copy, or Manuscript" of the poem together with "the full benefit, profit, and advantage thereof, or w[hic]h shall or may arise thereby"."\n\nThis contract is preserved in the British Library, London, and provides documentary evidence of the agreement between Milton and Simmons.

The Study identified the existence of different acts of reproduction – upstream and downstream – in the process of the act of making available, that may complicate the licensing of works for online use and have an impact in terms of conflicts of laws in case of infringement. However, the Study observed that the InfoSoc Directive does not regulate the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Both rights are autonomous and can apply cumulatively, so that a single technical act may simultaneously fall under the making available and the right of reproduction, even if those rights are managed separately. In a second part, the Study analyzed two criteria that could help localizing the making available right (country of origin principle and place of the exploitation of the work) and assessed which consequences they would have on the selected topics. It showed that these localization criteria would not solve the bottlenecks found under the current state of law with regard to the reproduction right, as both the uploader and the end user having access to a work made available online would still face issues regarding the copies made in the course of the technological process used.\n\nThe present Study deepens the analysis of the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Considering acts of streaming and downloading, it examines whether the copies of works made through the technical process of making them available on the internet fall under the scope of art. 2 of the InfoSoc Directive, and whether these may be exempted under the exception for temporary copy or the exception for private copy provided by art. 5.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/141219-study_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/141219-study_en.pdf\n|Reference=Walter and Von Lewinski (2010); Ginsburg (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Firstly, we have examined whether the definition of the exclusive rights and the qualification of online exploitations could provide a solution.\n\nSecondly, there could be an obligation upon the author or initial right holder to transfer only coherent bundles of rights to the effect that the licensee acquires all rights it needs for a particular form of exploitation of a work or other subject matter. This obligation could be extended to subsequent transfers of rights by derived right holders.\n\nThirdly, the right holders’ ability to license their rights could otherwise be limited in order to facilitate the exploitation of works and other subject matter in several Member States. One option is to impose compulsory licences for the first download following the public availability of the work or other subject matter.\n\nFinally, the territorial effects of the reproduction right can be attenuated to a certain extent by the modification of the exceptions.  On the one hand, the exception for temporary acts of reproduction could be extended to emphasise the incidental character of the reproduction and its lack of independent economic significance vis-à-vis the making available to the public of the work or other subject matter. On the other hand, the exception for “private copies” could exempt certain downloads of works made available to the public.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2011). Copyright Backlash. Southern California Law Review, 84.\n|Abstract=In the past decade the entertainment industry has waged a legally very successful campaign against online copyright infringements. In a series of high profile decisions, content industries persuaded courts to accept expansive interpretations of contributory enforcement, to create novel doctrines of copyright infringement, and to apply broad interpretations of statutory damage provisions. Many private file-sharers, technology companies, university administrators and Internet service providers have felt the reach of this litigation effort. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: even as the copyright industry has ramped up the level of deterrence, online copyright infringements continue unabated.\n\nWhy has the legal battle against file-sharers been so ineffective? The most straightforward explanation is that infringers are not deterred, either because the probability of getting caught remains remote or because the sanctions are not sufficiently salient. If that is the case, the expansive statutory damage award remedies in recent decisions such as Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset and Sony BMG v. Tenebaum, carry renewed promise for the entertainment industry. \n\nIn this Article we claim that this deterrence-based approach will prove futile and even counterproductive to the goals of copyright holders. We argue that copyright law faces conditions similar to Prohibition and other historical episodes of enforcement failure. When infringements are widespread, effective deterrence cannot be attained without raising enforcement to levels that undermine the support for the underlying rules. As a result, enforcement has the inadvertent effect of moving behavior in the opposite direction from that intended by the law. In the context of copyright law, enforcement has increased the gap between the social and legal perceptions of copyright law. Because file sharers, as a group, perceive copyright litigation as excessive, this inadvertently strengthens opposition to the legally protected interests of copyright law. \n\nTo further our understanding of the interplay between enforcement and public attitudes, we conduct two empirical studies on norms and copyright law. The results confirm that copyright enforcement is a double-edged sword. While stringent sanctions have a modest deterrent effect on file-sharing behavior, they increase anti-copyright sentiments among frequent offenders. This raises a spectacular challenge for copyright enforcement-the more copyright owners push to step up sanctions for copyright infringements; the more the public resents the protected rights. Consequently, stepping up sanctions tends to increase - rather than decrease - the rate and frequency of infringing activities. Our key results suggest therefore, that more stringent copyright enforcement will further erode respect for copyrights and may prove counterproductive to copyright owners.\n|Authentic Link=http://lawreview.usc.edu/index.php/articles-copyright-backlash/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=740184\n|Reference=Kahan (2000); Parisi and von Wangenheim (2004); Stuntz (2000); Boyle (2008); Lessig (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study found that severe and heightened enforcement of copyright law amongst students who illegally download music from file-sharing sites resulted in anti-copyright resentment, with a positive correlation between degree of backlash and amount of downloading prior to data collection; this suggests a tipping point for amount of downloads to influence a normative shift.

Intellectual property laws’ justification assumes that the more creations and inventions there are, the better off the population is. Therefore, the law promotes innovation and creativity without limits. This paper challenges this assumption by analysing empirically data on patents, trademarks and designs and on life satisfaction. It finds that there is no correlation between trademarks and designs and life satisfaction but a strong correlation between patents and life satisfaction. However passed a certain point, it is unclear whether more patents make people happier.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2337725\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main conclusion is however that there is an increase in the happiness of countries when more patents are introduced and this limit on happiness occurs at some point and thereafter levels off or declines. This may mean that patents are a way to increase the happiness in a country but only up a certain point.

While copyright enforcement\nagainst private copying traditionally centered on commercial intermediaries\nand piracy, content owners now also pursue infringement\nactions against consumers and private copiers\ndirectly. While consumers of pirated content have traditionally\nbeen captured indirectly through taxes or blanket licenses, they\nare now subjected to a mass litigation campaign.\nDespite the wide media attention and spectacular headlines,\nlitigation has produced only limited results in the present era of\ndigital downloading and peer-to-peer (or "P2P") file swapping.\nLawsuits against private copiers have not halted file-sharing activities.\nAn ever-increasing number of unlicensed downloads are\ntaking place in private homes all over the world. According to\nrecent data, over twelve million people\' are simultaneously sharing\n1.08 billion music, movie, and software files on the Internet at\nany given moment.\nWhy are individuals unresponsive to the increased costs ofdownloading unlicensed music? One possible reason is that individuals\nsimply believe that the chances of being caught are too\nremote because there are so many people downloading at any\ngiven moment in time. Downloading fell temporarily during the\ninitial wave of lawsuits but increased again during subsequent\nrounds of lawsuits as file swappers updated their estimation of\nthe chances of getting caught.3\nNotwithstanding the limited deterrent effect of lawsuits on file\nsharing, record industry representatives, who often refer to lawsuits\nin terms of "educating" the public on copyright law,4 have\nannounced that they will continue to pursue litigation against individual\nfile swappers. In this Article, we suggest that if litigation\nindeed serves purposes other than deterrence, legal sanctions are\nunlikely to alter the social meaning and legitimacy of peer-topeer\nnetworks and file sharing. Because of a convinced belief\namong copyright users that file sharing should be legal, copyright\nenforcement is challenged by a social norm complication. Drawing\non socio-psychological literature and new data from an empirical\nstudy, we posit that copyright litigation faces an\nimpossibility theorem: lawsuits against file sharers cannot simultaneously\nachieve effective deterrence and promote procopyright\nnorms.\nPart I provides an overview of recent copyright litigation\nagainst copyright infringers on file-sharing networks. In Part 2, we apply the rational choice paradigm to litigation of private\ncopying and complement it with norm-based approaches.\nPart III examines behavioral adjustments and social norms effects\nin a scenario study where students are subjected to varying\nmodalities of copyright law enforcement. The aim of the study is\nto investigate the effect of copyright law enforcement on anticopyright\nnorms among file swappers on peer-to-peer networks\nand to examine differences between experienced users of filesharing\ntechnologies and individuals who have not (yet) engaged\nin file sharing.\nThe evidence from our study raises the hypothesis that deterrence\nand norms work at cross-purposes. Experienced users of\npeer-to-peer technology have internalized an anticopyright norm\nthat cannot be unraveled through enforcement. Anticopyright\nnorms of file swapppers are strengthened when the level of copyright\nenforcement increases, which results in more downloading\nwhenever enforcement is temporarily suspended. Enforcement has an ambivalent effect on individuals who have no experience\nwith file sharing. Severe sanctions do not have a counterproductive\neffect on copyright norms of such "non-file sharers," yet exposure\nto information on copyright enforcement against peer-topeer\nsoftware reinforces the belief or expectation that others are\ndownloading.\nPart IV reflects on the lessons learned from the study, in particular\nwith regard to the policy choices that regulators, courts,\nand copyright-dependent industries face when approaching the\nwidespread use of copyrighted material on file-sharing networks.\nThese options, including criminal prosecutions of digital piracy,\ncopyright education, self-help strategies, and collective licensing,\nare evaluated in light of the interaction of deterrence and anticopyright\nnorms. We will argue that social norm backlash is\nparticularly relevant for copyright law because circumvention\ntechnology and the so-called technological "arms race" between\ncontent holders and pirates inevitably create lapses in copyright\nenforcement. During these intervals of reduced enforcement,\nconduct is determined by norms.\nFinally, Part V considers the recent decision by the Supreme\nCourt in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., which held that\nproducers of file-sharing applications can potentially be held ac-countable for distributing software. Because Grokster focuses\non the commercial intent of P2P producers, it is doubtful that the\ndecision will be an effective tool in reducing the availability of\nfile-sharing technology. As digital technology becomes more decentralized,\nit is increasingly judgment-proof. File-sharing applications\nare produced in user-driven innovation environments\nthat operate without centralized, residual claimants. Life cycles\nof software applications extend beyond the legal and financial\nstatus of their creators. This suggests that we have only seen the\ntip of the iceberg with regard to lawsuits against private copiers.\nWe use copyright enforcement as a case study for the interaction\nbetween law enforcement and norms in general. The literature\non social norms suggests that when legal sanctions violate\nthe subjective conception of behavior that is being punished, individuals\nrespond differently when that enforcement coincides\nwith preexisting notions of what is just or appropriate. Although\nsome studies have investigated the conflict of deterrence and\nnorms with regard to tax evasion, the dynamics of social norms\nand law enforcement remain poorly understood. This Article addresses\nseveral gaps in the existing literature. While there is an\nabundance of theoretical attention to social norms, there is little\nempirical data on the interaction between norms and law enforcement.\nAlso, this Article supplements the limited literature\non enforcement patterns in copyright law.\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=F.

Rev., 55, 301.\n|Abstract=According to the incentive theory of copyright, financial rewards are what the public trades for the production of creative works. To know whether this quid pro quo is working, one needs to know how much the creators are getting from the bargain. Based on an original, nationwide survey of more than 5,000 musicians, this Article addresses one of the key links in the incentive theory's chain of logic. For most musicians, copyright does not provide much of a direct financial reward for what they are producing currently. The survey findings are instead consistent with a winner-take-all or superstar model in which copyright motivates musicians through the promise of large rewards in the future in the rare event of wide popularity\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199058\n|Link=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/arz55&div=15&id=&page=\n|Reference=Fisher (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Rather than providing marginal incentives to create for all musicians at all times, copyright law mostly affects the revenue of the highest-income musicians in a direct fashion.\n\nMost musicians earn a relatively small portion of their revenue from sources directly related to copyright.\n\nThus, a hypothetical boost in revenue from more effective enforcement would only increase the average musician's total revenue by a small amount today, in the short term.\n\nIf the hypothetical copyright enforcement legislation helps those entities, it is possible that musicians might benefit from greater royalty income and other changes in intermediaries' policies. \n\nStronger copyright enforcement might provide musicians with incentives to move up the income ladder in a winner-take-all kind of market. It will not, however, put more money in their pocket today.\n\nBetter enforcement could help record labels' bottom lines to an extent that the labels could begin offering larger advances and greater support to artists again.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Intellectual property laws’ justification assumes that the more creations and inventions there are, the better off the population is. Therefore, the law promotes innovation and creativity without limits. This paper challenges this assumption by analysing empirically data on patents, trademarks and designs and on life satisfaction. It finds that there is no correlation between trademarks and designs and life satisfaction but a strong correlation between patents and life satisfaction. However passed a certain point, it is unclear whether more patents make people happier.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2337725\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main conclusion is however that there is an increase in the happiness of countries when more patents are introduced and this limit on happiness occurs at some point and thereafter levels off or declines.

Future research will be directed at trying to understand why increasing the number of patents per person beyond 104.6 does not lead to an increase in the happiness in the country.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The American Economic Review 88.4 (1998): 970-983.\n|Abstract=In a market economy, there is no clear implication as to whether economic activities will tend to reduce or else to widen initial wealth disparities. When it comes to political or military struggles, in contrast, it might be expected that initially stronger or richer contenders would grow ever stronger and richer still. What has been termed the Paradox of Power (Hirshleifer, 1991) is the observation that very often the reverse occurs: poorer or weaker contestants improve their position relative to richer or stronger opponents. In warfare, small nations have often defeated larger ones, as notably occurred in Vietnam. Individuals, groups, or nations - if rational and self-interested - will equalize the marginal returns of two main ways of generating income: production and mutually advantageous exchange, versus appropriate efforts designed to redistribute income or capture resources previously controlled by other parties.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/117014\n|Reference=Hirshleifer (1991;\n|Plain Text Proposition=We tested two main kinds of predictions: ( 1 ) The first group dealt \'with issues common to much of the game-theoretic and experimental literature. Of these, the major question was the degree to which the experimental outcomes approximated the noncooperative Nash solution, as opposed to a more cooperative outcome generating a larger in- come for the group as a whole. We also compared protocols with randomly varying partners each round as opposed to fixed partners over the entire sequence of play. (2) The second group of predictions dealt with inferences from the specific model of conflict in Hirshleifer ( 1991 ), and specifically those associated with the Paradox of Power. The paradox is that, in many situations, an initially poorer side will end up gaining in relative position in comparison with an initially richer and thus stronger opponent. With regard to the first group of predictions, the experimental observations overwhelmingly supported the Nash as opposed to the Cooperative solution. However, while the Nash solution is much better supported in a dichotomous comparison between the two, the experimental results typically displayed some degree of slippage in the direction of cooperation. The convergence toward Nash was weaker under the fixed partners as opposed to the varying partners protocol, and also was weaker in the mature (sixteenth round) choices than the overall behavior. Together with an observed tendency toward positive correlation of the deviations from the Nash equilibrium, these results are consistent with a "leaming to cooperate" interpretation. Fixed partners over multiple rounds of interaction favor the development of mutual understanding relative to varying partners. Still, we must reemphasize, overall the results were dominated by noncooperative (Nash) behavior.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

This will lead to the formulation of some recommendations that, by viewing the public domain as material that should receive some positive status and protection, might help to support a robust public domain, as advocated by the Development Agenda.\n\nOur purpose is not to define what should be or not be in the public domain, nor to look\nat the causes of the shrinking of the public domain, or only incidentally. This study is\nsituated beyond the debate as to what should be copyrighted or not, to what extent and for how long. It will not deal with the question of determination of those limitations to intellectual property (as to the scope of the rights, the object of the protection, the adequate duration of the right, etc.). Such delineation is fundamentally a matter for policy that has to be decided by States, both at an international and national level.\nAs a consequence, the public domain that will be sketched here is not only what is left\nafter the contours of copyright have been drawn, but is a repository of resources of its own.\n\nAccordingly, the recommendations formulated at the end of this study will not focus on the\nscope of copyright and the way to curb it, but will rather try to develop strategies to make the public domain itself flourish and be made more available to the public. This study will also be limited to the public domain as resulting from copyright legal regimes and not by patent or trademark.\n\nPart I of this study will give an evaluation of the role of the public domain in copyright,\nstarting by a definition of what public domain is and what it should be distinguished from.\nThe public domain in the history and justification of copyright will also be provided.\nPart II will identify the components of the public domain, notably based on an\nillustrative comparison of national legislation. It will also analyse other legislatively granted rights and/or interests that may modify and interfere with the level of accessibility and usability of the copyright-related public domain. Part III will provide a survey of non-legislative and private ordering initiatives, which provide for greater access, use, identification and location of the public domain and other creative material whose conditions of use are akin thereto. Part IV will sketch a possible future for the public domain, by developing the impetus it is gaining in legislative and judicial contexts, the key principles that could govern it for a more positive status, and finally by formulating recommendations in regard to future activities on the public domain in relation to copyright that may be carried out by the World Intellectual Property Organization.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=161162\n|Link=http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=161162\n|Reference=Bolye (2008); Ginsburg (2010); Deazley (2006); Ricketson (2003); Hess and Ostrom (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=As far as identification of the public domain is concerned:\n\no The territoriality applying to the determination of the public domain should be further\nassessed. Recommendations are difficult to propose in that regard as substituting the\nlaw of the country of origin to the lex loci protectionis would only shift the uncertainty.\nInstead of having to deal with different laws when envisaging an exploitation of creative\nmaterial in different jurisdictions, the user will have to determine the status of the\nresources used according to the law of countries of origin, even for an exploitation\noccurring in a single country.\n\no The difficulty of the rule of the comparison of terms applicable to the duration for\nprotection, as provided by Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention, should at least be\nassessed.\no The voluntary relinquishment of copyright in works and dedication to the public domain\nshould be recognised as a legitimate exercise of authorship and copyright exclusivity, to the extent permitted by national laws (possibly excluding any abandonment of moral rights) and upon the condition of a formally expressed, informed and free consent of the author. Further research could certainly be carried out on that point.\n\no An exception or attenuation of the lex loci protectionis could be envisaged so as to\nmutually recognize the validity of a dedication to the public domain when valid in the\ncountry of origin of the work.\n\no The issue of orphan works should be dealt with at the international level or at least, a\nmutual recognition of the status of the orphan work applied in one country should be\nrecognized by other Parties to the Berne Convention (except when identification or location of the author can be solved in this other country). WIPO should also help to set up networks of information about works in order to facilitate the identification of authors of orphan works. This would clarify the protected or unprotected status of orphan works.\n\no International endeavours should be devoted to developing technical or informational\ntools to identify the contents of the public domain, particularly as far as the duration of\ncopyright is concerned. Such tools can be data collections on works, databases of public domain works, or public domain calculators. International cross-operation and cross-referencing of such tools is of particular importance.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties could be modified to integrate, in the definition of “Rights\nManagement Information”, any electronic information pertaining to public domain works.\n\n- As far as the availability and sustainability of the public domain is concerned:\no The availability of the public domain should be enhanced, notably through cooperation\nwith cultural heritage institutions and UNESCO (through its work on the preservation of\nintangible cultural heritage).\n\no Legal deposit should be encouraged at national level, which might involve some\nfinancial and logistical help for developing countries. At international level, catalogues\nand cross-referencing of deposited works should be set up.\n\no The role of cultural heritage institutions, and mainly libraries, in the labelling,\ncataloguing, preserving and making available of public domain works, should be\nrecognised and supported, particularly in the digital environment.\n\no Research should be carried out to identify means to promote the divulgation and\nexploitation of public domain material in terms of funding and incentives. The research\ncould include the tool of the domaine public payant, as means to make commercial\nusers of public domain works contribute, through a minimal sum, to the collecting and\nmaintaining of public domain material carried out by public institutions. Where the moral\nright is perpetual, there should be ways of controlling possible abuses in exercising the\ndivulgation or integrity right.\n\no Any extension of the scope or duration of copyright and related rights, both at\ninternational and national level, should take into account the empirical effects on the\nsustainability of the public domain.\n\n- As far as the non-exclusivity and non-rivalry of the public domain is concerned:\no Legal means should be found to prevent the recapture of exclusivity in works that have\nfallen into the public domain, whether through another intellectual property right\n(trademark or right in databases), property rights, other legal entitlements or technical\nprotection, if such exclusivity is similar in scope or effect to that of copyright or is\ndetrimental to non-rivalrous or concurrent uses of the public domain work.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties should be amended to prohibit a technical impediment to\nreproduce, publicly communicate or making available a work that has fallen into the\npublic domain. There is no legal basis for the enforcement of technical protection\nmeasures applied to the public domain, as public domain status should guarantee the\nright to make re-use, modification, reproduction and communication. It could also be\nclarified that only technological measures protecting copyrighted works that form a\nsubstantial part of the digital content to which they apply will be protected against\ncircumvention. Technological measures mainly protecting public domain works, with an\nancillary and minimal presence of copyrighted works, should not enjoy legal protection.\n\no As Berne countries are required to respect within their territory the intellectual property\nprotection granted by other countries, they should recognize the public domain status\ndefined by other countries and prevent privatization of what is in the public domain\nelsewhere.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Exceptions (distinguish innovation and public policy purposes; open-ended/closed list; commercial/non-commercial distinction),\n|Intervention-Response=The construction of a positive regime for the public domain, able to buttress the principles emphasized above would require both the adoption of normative rules in copyright laws and the setting up of material conditions to effectively enable access to, enjoyment and preservation of public domain resources. It is thus difficult to draw precise recommendations with a normative effect, as endeavours should be pervasive and might go beyond formal changes in intellectual\nproperty laws. Action might also be more appropriate at national level. The following recommendations [Main results] do not propose to curb the scope or duration of copyright in any way, mainly as it is a matter for national public policy.\n|Description of Data=Comparative legal analysis of the copyright laws and public domain in 14 countries.w\n|Data Year=2010\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=Copyright laws;\n|Method of Collection=Document Research, Qualitative content/text mining\n|Method of Analysis=Textual Content Analysis, Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Film and motion pictures; Sound recording and music publishing; Photographic activities; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=Global;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=Yes\n|Funded By=World Intellectual Property Organization;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=14\n|Level of Aggregation=Country,\n|Data Material Year=2010\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2293, 'title': 'Dusollier, S.', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2314, 'title': 'E02: Institutions and the Macroeconomy', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Discipline}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2598, 'title': 'E03: Behavioral Macroeconomics', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Discipline}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2687, 'title': 'Dyuti Banerjee, Tanmoyee Banerjee and Ajitava Raychaudhuri', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

International Journal of Cultural Policy, 21(1), 60-77.\n|Abstract=Digitization and the internet have posed an acute economic challenge to rights holders in the cultural industries. Faced with a threat to their form of capital accumulation from copyright infringement, rights holders have used discourse strategically in order to try and legitimate and strengthen their position in the digital copyright debate with governments and media users. In so doing, they have appealed to general justificatory principles – about what is good, right, and just – that provide some scope for opposition and critique, as other groups contest their interpretation of these principles and the evidence used to support them. In this article, we address the relative lack of academic attention paid to the role of discourse in copyright debates by analysing user-directed marketing campaigns and submissions to UK government policy consultations. We show how legitimacy claims are justified and critiqued, and conclude that amid these debates rests some hope of achieving a more legitimate policy resolution to the copyright wars – or at least the possibility of beginning a more constructive dialogue.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10286632.2013.874421\n|Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10286632.2013.874421\n|Reference=Boltanski and Thévenot (2006); Boltanski and Chiapello (2005); Fairclough (2004); Fairclough (2003); Chiapello and Fairclough (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Discourse can play a strategic role, alongside structural advantages, in promoting the interests of particular groups \n\n* Discourse should not be reduced entirely to economic interests and so dismissed as just so much more ideology in the Marxian sense. Rather, in legitimating economic arrangements actors appeal to general justificatory principles – about what is good, right and just – which involve a broader claim to public legitimacy. \n\n* Policy consultations do not always translate neatly into political outcomes and may be short circuited by other processes such as the direct lobbying of politicians\n\n* The rights holders’ strategic use of discourse reinforces the structural advantages they already tend to enjoy in the copyright debate. As a result, the copyright debate remains a far cry from a more deliberative process of copyright policy-making where a more legitimate détente to the copyright wars may be achieved.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Intellectual Property Office Research Paper.\n|Abstract=The purpose of this research study is 1) to map the size of the public domain and frequency of its use; 2) analyse the role of public domain works in value creation for UK businesses; 3) assist creators and entrepreneurs to identify business models that benefit from the public domain. In addition to these outputs, the intellectual contribution of this project was to arrive at a sufficiently precise definition of the public domain to permit measurement of its value, and secondly, to critically appraise theories of creativity and innovation that explain how value might be generated from non-exclusive use of ideas and works available to all. The non-rival, non-excludable nature of the public domain would seem to limit its appeal to creators in a competitive market. Any observed commercial uptake of public domain material consequently raises important questions: What stimulates creators to invest in transforming or re-publishing public domain works? How do firms gain and sustain competitive advantage when exploiting freely available public domain materials? Finally, what policy options are available to promote market uptake of public domain materials, and what are the likely impacts?\n|Authentic Link=https://zenodo.org/record/14975/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2015-01.pdf\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2571220\n|Reference=Buccafusco and Heald (2013); Heald (2007); Nagaraj (2013); Pollock and Stepan (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Researchers identified the following issues relating to public domain uptake in Study 1:\n\n*Creators working with visual or multimedia content reported difficulties in  locating and securing high-quality sources of public domain works (image resolution, digital format). This was a significant challenge to commercialisation.\n\n*Archives, museums, and libraries were frequently cited as useful partners when seeking access to public domain works, able to provide access to source material and data needed to ascertain copyright status of work.\n\n*There was little concern about competition due to non-excludability of source material, but firms worried about costs of marketing and sustaining PD projects when initial development cost and investment was also low.\n\n*Clarity on legal use (e.g. requirements for ‘diligent search’ when using orphan  works) would improve commercialisation potential.\n\nThe main findings for Study 2 were as follows:\n\n*Use of both public domain and third party licensed material were significantly associated with higher likelihood of project success.\n\n*Influence of public domain status on success rate was most pronounced in the mediums of Comics and Theatre, compared with Publishing and Video Games. This suggests that the role of PD materials differs across mediums. Direct re-publication of public domain literature does not seem to be rewarded – aptation to another medium may be more attractive to backers. \n\n*Explicitly obtaining copyright permission to use a third party work in a Kickstarter pitch was significantly associated with higher funding levels achieved.\n\n*Previous experience and status of pitch creator was also significant to project success, suggesting that familiarity of both underlying work and its creator is important to Kickstarter funders.\n\nStudy 3 found: \n\n*Public domain availability makes a significant difference to inclusion of images on Wikipedia. Biographies for notable authors born prior to 1880 have a greater likelihood of containing an image than those born more recently, even though camera  technology became widespread in the 20th Century. Less than 58% of authors in the sample born after 1880 have images associated with their Wikipedia pages.  \n\n*Controlling for notoriety of authors, composers and lyricists using a  matched-pairs technique, we found that pages with public domain images attracted between 17% and  19% more visitors than pages where no image was available, reflecting the value those images contribute to the Wikipedia resource.\n\n*Using commercially equivalent licence fees obtained from Corbis and Getty for images relating to the biographical sample, we estimate a total value of USD $208 million (GBP £138million) per year for the 1,983,609 English-language Wikipedia pages in appropriate categories which contain public domain images.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

As much as possible, members of the public and stakeholder communities should be offered the opportunity to be involved in curating, preserving and disseminating public  domain materials. Ideally, outputs should be of professional quality and should be presented in formats which are machine-readable, manipulable, and adaptable to different mediums (to facilitate downstream use).\n\n*As far as possible, clarify legal status of public domain; Government should provide guidance on those issues, in a format that is accessible to creators and businesses.  Educational initiatives should be aimed at helping UK firms understand what is likely  to  be  still  in copyright and what is likely to be in the public domain.  Increasing the strategic capabilities of the UK media sector with respect to intellectual property will likely increase licensing of copyright works alongside uptake of public domain materials – both types of usage require similar legal awareness and capacity.  \n\n*Improve access to information; many respondents focused their concern on transaction costs, as searching for and using public domain materials was often more costly than licensing a less-suitable copyright work or hiring-in a replacement original work,  disinhibiting creation. Information about availability and access to public domain  works will help entrepreneurs make strategic decisions. Centralised databases of works with associated metadata, such as the Wikimedia Commons project, have sought to overcome such problems in limited, specific contexts. Initiatives to increase the  centralisation and searchability of public domain data will likely lower these barriers to entry and encourage innovation and new products.\n|Description of Data=Study 1: Commercial uptake by creative businesses\nThis  study  consisted  of  interviews  with  22 creative  businesses that  used  public  domain materials to create commercial products.\n\nStudy 2: Public domain projects on Kickstarter \nIn order to assess the role of public domain material in a crowdfunded creative marketplace, the  team  performed  quantitative  analysis  on  1,933 Kickstarter   projects from January to April 2014. \n\nStudy 3: Impact of availability of public domain images on Wikipedia \nTo assess the value of public domain images in the context of this resource, researchers studied the presence and impact of public domain images on biographical Wikipedia pages of 1,700 literary authors, lyricists and composers.\n|Data Year=2014\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Web analytic (online user trace data), Qualitative Collection Methods, Semi-Structured Interview\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Cluster analysis, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association, Multivariate Statistics, Regression Analysis, Qualitative Analysis Methods, Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data)\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Software publishing (including video games); Cultural education; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=United Kingdom; United States;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Funded By=IPO;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=22\n|Level of Aggregation=Company,\n|Data Material Year=2014\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=1933\n|Level of Aggregation=Kickstarter projects,\n|Data Material Year=January - April 2014\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=1700\n|Level of Aggregation=Wikipedia pages,\n|Data Material Year=2014\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1407, 'title': 'Engel and Kurschilgen (2010)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Engel and Kurschilgen (2010)\n|Author=Engel, C.; Kurschilgen, M.J.\n|Title=Fairness Ex Ante and Ex Post: An Experimental Test of the German “Bestseller Paragraph”\n|Year=2010\n|Full Citation=Engel, C., & Kurschilgen, M.

At the moment when the owner of intellectual property grants a licence (“ex\nante”), neither party knows the true value of the traded commodity. A seemingly odd provision\nfrom German copyright law, the so-called “bestseller paragraph”, stipulates that the seller of a\nlicence has a legally enforceable right to a bonus in case the work (“ex post”) turns out a blockbuster.\nWe experimentally explore the effect of the provision on market prices, on the number of\ndeals struck and on perceived fairness. Our results show that the provision leads to lower prices\nfor copyrights. More copyrights trade.

(2013). Copyright and the Economic Effects of Parody: An Empirical Study of Music Videos on the YouTube Platform and an Assessment of the Regulatory Options. Intellectual Property Office Research Paper, (2013/24).\n|Abstract=The status of parody and related derivative works within the UK copyright framework lacks clarity and has been recommended for further policy study in two recent independent reviews: the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property in 2006 and the more recent Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth published in 2011.  \n\nThe review documents highlight the dual importance of parodic works both as a form of cultural expression and as a potential source of innovation and growth. A key recommendation made by Hargreaves is that the Government create a new fair dealing copyright exception for parody. However, a shortage of empirical data renders policy intervention in this area difficult. The issue is complicated by the inherently creative nature of parody, ambiguity about its definition and the multiplicity of \neconomic and legal approaches that may be applied. \n\nIn December 2011, following a call to tender procedure, the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) commissioned the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management (CIPPM) at Bournemouth University to undertake research into the potential effects for rightsholders, creators and audiences of introducing a copyright exception for Parody in the UK. This synopsis reports the key findings from two complementary studies carried out by the researchers. Study I presents new empirical data about the rate and nature of parody content production on the online video platform YouTube, and its impact on commercial exploitation of original works where they can be considered to be part of the same market.  Study II distils regulatory options for a parody exception from a comparative review of seven jurisdictions. \n\nThe current synopsis document contains three parts. First, it discusses the empirical findings from Study I. A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011. Secondly, this synopsis presents a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven  jurisdictions  that  have  implemented  or  are  considering  implementing  a  copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying  principles  (including  economic  and  constitutional)  governing  divergent  legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented. Thirdly, this synopsis document provides a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data. Each of the policy options identified in Study II is examined for its likely impact on the empirical sample gathered in Study I. Finally, some recommendations are made.\n|Authentic Link=https://zenodo.org/record/8374/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2013-04.pdf\n|Reference=Rogers, Tomalin and Corrigan (2009); Deazley (2010); Landes and Posner (2003); Handke (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The key findings are:\n\n*Parody is a significant consumer activity: On average, there are 24 user-generated parodies available for each original video of a charting single.\n\n*There is no evidence for economic damage to rights holders through substitution: The presence of parody content is correlated with, and predicts larger audiences for original music videos.\n\n*The potential for reputational harm in the observed sample is limited: Only 1.5% of all parodies sampled took a directly negative stance, discouraging viewers from commercially supporting the original.\n\n*Observed creative contributions were considerable: In 78% of all cases, the parodist appeared on camera (also diminishing the possibility of confusion).\n\n*There exists a small but growing market for skilled user-generated parody: Parodists who exhibit higher production values in their works attract larger audiences, which can be monetised via revenue share with YouTube.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

It is recommended that any policy be crafted in such a way as to minimise the need for subjective judgments about what constitutes humoristic or target parody, as opposed to other types of work.\n\n*In order to realise the benefits of economic growth, allow commercial parody: Providing a legal framework which allows amateurs and small producers to monetise their intellectual contributions will likely result in an increase in new works. \n\n*If an economic test is introduced, focus on incentive rationale and substitution effects: If policy makers want to resist (in Hargreaves’ words) ‘over-regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators’, the focus needs to be on the threat of substitution of the original by the parody \n\n*Consider responsiveness to changing cultural and technological circumstances: It is recommended that any interpretation of intellectual input or transformative use remain sensitive to the rapidly changing cultural practices enabled by online tools.\n|Description of Data=A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011.\n|Data Year=2011\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=LexisNexis; Wired Magazine; CitiGroup; Digital Music Times; Quora;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Web analytic (online user trace data), Quantitative data/text mining\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Cluster analysis, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=Australia; Canada; France; Germany; United Kingdom; United States; The Netherlands;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Funded By=IPO;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=8299\n|Level of Aggregation=user-generated music video parodies,\n|Data Material Year=2011\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1523, 'title': 'European Commission (2011)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=European Commission (2011)\n|Author=European Commission\n|Title=Report on the Implementation and Effect of the Resale Right Directive (2001/84/EC)\n|Year=2011\n|Full Citation=Report on the Implementation and Effect of the Resale Right Directive (2001/84/EC), European Commission (2011), available at\n|Abstract=The Resale Right Directive (2001/84/EC of 27 September 2001) (\'the Directive\') was conceived with two major objectives in mind: to "ensure that authors of graphic and plastic works of art share in the economic success of their original works of art"1 on the one hand and, on the other, to harmonise the application of the right across the EU. It was considered that "The application or non-application of such a right has a significant impact on the competitive environment within the internal market, since the existence or absence of an obligation to pay on the basis of the resale right is an element which must be taken into account by each individual wishing to sell a work of art. This right is therefore a factor which contributes to the creation of distortions of competition as well as displacement of sales within the Community."\n\nConsistent with these aims, the Directive promoted harmonisation of the substantive conditions for the application of the resale right: (i) eligibility and the duration of protection; (ii) the categories of works of art to which the resale right applies; (iii) the scope of the acts to\nbe covered i.e. all acts involving dealers in works of art; (iv) the royalty rates applicable across defined price bands; (v) the maximum threshold for a minimum resale price attracting\nthe right (€3,000); and (vi) provisions on third country nationals entitled to receive royalties. The Directive came into force on 1 January 2006.\n\nAt the time the Directive was agreed 4 of the then 15 Member States did not apply the resale right in national law: Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These Member States enjoyed a transitional period to 1 January 2010 during which they could choose not to apply the resale right to the works of eligible deceased artists. These Member States, together with Malta, made use of this provision, and of the option to extend the derogation period for a further 2 years. This derogation comes to an end on 1 January 2012, at which point the Directive must be fully implemented in all Member States.\n\nArticle 11 of the Directive foresees that the Commission should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the implementation and the effect of the Directive. This report answers to that requirement. In line with the provisions of Article 11 this Report examines in particular the impact of the Directive on the internal market and the effect of the introduction of the resale right in those Member States that did not apply the right in national law prior to the entry into force of this Directive. It pays particular attention to the position of the Community in relation to relevant markets that do not apply the resale right, assesses the role of the Directive in the fostering of artistic creativity and reviews the situation with regard to the management procedures in the Member States.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/resale/report_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/resale/report_en.pdf\n|Reference=Froschauer (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=No clear patterns can be established to link the loss of the EU\'s share in the global market for\nmodern and contemporary art with the harmonisation of provisions relating to the application of the resale right in the EU on 1 January 2006. Neither can any clear patterns currently be established that would indicate systematic trade diversion within the EU away from those Member States which introduced the right for living artists in 2006. Nevertheless, there are clearly pressures on European art markets, in all price ranges, and for both the auction and dealer sectors, and it is recalled that the scope of the application of the resale right will be significantly expanded following the ending of the derogation for the works of deceased artists on 1 January 2012.\nAt the same time, the quality of the administration of the resale right appears to vary considerably across the EU, bringing costs to art market professionals and artists alike. The burden can be particularly high for those at the lower end of the market who are proportionately more deeply affected by the costs of administering the right. The Commission recognises, furthermore, that in some Member States inefficient administration of the resale right presents a not insignificant burden on art market professionals and may also lead to unnecessarily high deductions from the royalties due to artists and their successors.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

The Commission will undertake a further reporting exercise and deliver its results in 2014.  The Commission will also pursue its commitment to persuading third countries to implement the resale right.\n• In light of the volume of transactions subject to the resale right, the European Commission also considers that there would be benefit in the exchange of best practice at European level with a view to managing and minimising the administrative costs in all Member states. To this end it intends to establish a Stakeholder Dialogue, tasked with making recommendations for the improvement of the system of resale right collection and distribution in the EU.\n• More broadly, the European Commission is concerned that collecting societies should operate to a high standard of governance and transparency with regard to their members and to commercial users, and will bring forward a proposal in this regard during 2012 to apply in equal measure to collecting societies administering the resale right.\n|Description of Data=In preparing this Report, the Commission conducted a broad-based public consultation on all key questions identified in Article 11, including seeking information from Member States. 503 responses were received for publication. Of these the vast majority (422) were from citizens - artists\' successors in title (248, primarily in France and Italy) and artists (174, primarily from France and the UK). Responses were also received from art market professionals (48), collecting societies, artists\' trade associations and some public authorities.\n|Data Year=2010-2011\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Artnet;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Quantitative data/text mining, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining), Correlation and Association, Textual Content Analysis, Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=European Union;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Funded By=European Commission;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=503\n|Level of Aggregation=Stakeholders,\n|Data Material Year=2010\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1822, 'title': 'Ethnography', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Method\n|Qualitative=true}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1881, 'title': 'Ethnographic/narrative analysis', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Method\n|Qualitative=true}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

Data generated by the public sector can be used as raw material for innovative value-added services and products which boost the economy by creating new jobs and encouraging investment in data-driven sectors. They also play a role in increasing government accountability and transparency. These benefits have recently been recognised by the G8 leaders and enshrined in an Open Data Charter.\n\nYet, studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission show that industry and citizens still face difficul ties in finding and re-using it. In response, in December 2011 the Commission adopted a package of measures (2) to overcome barriers to re-use and reduce the fragmentation of data markets. The key element was the recently adopted Directive 2013/37/EU amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information.\n\nThe amended Directive calls on the Commission to help the Member States implement the new rules by issuing guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re-use of documents. The guide lines are an important element of the Commission’s efforts to help the EU’s economy to generate more value from data (including scientific data and ‘big data’ from other sources than the public sector). They will also facilitate the roll-out of open data infrastructures under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\n\nIn August 2013, the Commission launched an online consultation followed by a public hearing and a meeting of a Member States expert group on PSI. The aim was to gather the views of all interested parties on the scope and content of the future Commission guidelines.  The purpose of this Commission Notice is to provide non-binding guidance on the best practices within the three subject areas of particular relevance for the re-use of public sector information in Europe.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=6421.\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=6421.\n|Reference=Vickery (2011); LAPSI Interoperability Report (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The feedback received shows an increasing trend towards a more open and interoperable licensing system in Europe and agreement on the need for the speedy release of several high-value datasets. With regard to charging, it is clear that a wide range of approaches are in operation, but the newly introduced pricing principles were not called into question by the majority of respondents. The PSI re-use market in Europe is still under development and that guidance on the key elements of the recently revised Directive is urgently needed if full advantage is to be taken of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities offered by the re-use of public data.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Copyright enforcement influences the quantity and quality of new products, the volume of sales, innovation, creativity and ultimately welfare. The existing empirical literature focuses on some of these factors in isolation. However, practice, policy and research suggest that the evidence on the overall impact of copyright enforcement is far from being conclusive.\n\nThe existing theories and legal traditions emphasize the importance of different aspects of enforcement, such as the detection, deterrence, rehabilitation, and punishment of criminals and infringers. According to Weatherall et al. (2009) the literature has focused on very broad copyright issues, such as intellectual property (IP) rights as a whole, and on very narrow cases where court judgements have been made, leaving the interesting area in between unexplored. Hall et al. (2014) examine this overlooked region by contrasting formal and informal IP. They reveal that costly litigation practices in several occasions tend to encourage secrecy over patents. An interlinked crucial but challenging feature of law enforcement relates to prevention and its association with awareness, education and technology. Unambiguously, technological progress has boosted the volume of piracy but it has also facilitated the prevention of unauthorised copying, through takedowns of infringing websites, for instance. In particular, this type of technological enforcement has become increasingly important over the past decade.\n\n\n''Policy interventions''\n\nRecent policy interventions focus mainly on measuring unlawful behaviour and quantifying infringement, separating copyright infringements from copyright criminal offenses, distinguishing commercial from non-commercial use, calculating intermediary liability, enhancing education, digital literacy and awareness, comparing different enforcement practices, such as demand- and supply-side sanctions, graduated responses, sites blocking, mediation versus litigation and court proceeding, among others. \n\nCopyright policy interventions are concentrated on both consumption and production. Demand-side sanctions target individual subscribers via graduated response letter warnings, slowing down Internet speed for infringers (throttling back), termination of access, fines and imprisonment. Supply-side sanctions, on the other hand, focus on infringing companies via blocking sites, targeting intermediaries (follow the money approach), legal action, and increasing consumers’ awareness with clean sites lists, among others. Different countries follow different approaches. In continental Europe enforcement is undertaken mainly by agencies of the state, whereas in Anglo-Saxon countries they work jointly with private actors (see IPO, 2015). \n\nA major policy challenge relates to intermediary liability. The extent to which communications platforms, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook or open Wi-Fi administrators, are liable for their users’ behaviour remains a hotly debatable subject, while its association with innovation, freedom of expression and aggressive online activity, renders this issue as a key concern for enforcement. Among other interventions governments attempt to receive assistance from intermediaries for the implementation of copyright law. The introduction of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) in the US and the 2000 Electronic Commerce Directive in the EU, which implemented treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), focus precisely on intermediary liability and criminalise both the dissemination of protected material without permission and the circumvention of copyright controls in response to notices and takedowns. \n\nIn the presence of infringement and when copyright exceptions do not apply, enforcement can be imposed in different forms. When infringement is detected and the rights holders choose action instead of inaction, an important distinction relates to the type of action and in particular to the option between judgement and settlement. Settlement and resolution of the matter with infringers directly can save time and money before starting court proceeding – this includes Alternative Dispute Resolutions (ADR), such as arbitrations and mediations. If, however, such efforts are unsuccessful, litigation through the court system might be a more efficient but also a costlier and lengthier way to resolve the dispute. \n\n\n''Existing evidence''\n\nRecent evidence suggests that the transition to a global digital economy is associated with new challenges for enforcement. Online user behaviour and copyright infringement take new forms, as, for instance, physical activity becomes digital in an increasing pace, posing additional threats to the implementation of copyright law. Criminal IP offenses (also known as counterfeiting or piracy), which are often connected with organised crime, manufacture, distribution and commercial sale, have changed dramatically too, as technological progress simplified the production of unauthorised copies and digitization widened the market considerably. \n\nThe appropriate scope of copyright protection is a matter of debate (see Exceptions). To what extent non-commercial activities should come within the ambit of enforcement requires particular attention. Importantly, non-profit organisations, such as universities or the education sector as a whole, may engage in activities which are considered to be commercial, thus falling under the same copyright rules as commercial enterprises. There is a tension between the generation of income pursued by these organisations, and the (desirable) promotion of education, scientific knowledge and innovation. At the same time it raises distributional deliberations regarding the access to education and the equality of opportunity, as different institutions, which typically educate students from certain socioeconomic backgrounds, might have dissimilar capacities to stay within copyright law. The accessibility of resources through open data and open access publishing remains one of the most topical issues about copyright enforcement and its relation to knowledge, science and innovation (see Frosio, 2014).\n\nShifting attention to distinctively commercial activities and in particular to the music industry Liebowitz (2014) shows that global recorded music sales decreased by 50% in the ten years after the introduction of Napster in 1999, while before that they were on an upward trend. In response to this during the past decade there have been several antipiracy policy interventions, while researchers have evaluated the effectiveness for only a small subset of them. Among the demand side antipiracy legislations are HADOPI and IPRED, both of which have been passed in 2009 in France and in Sweden, respectively. The former has been implemented via graduate responses and has been evaluated by Danaher et al. (2014), who provide evidence of a 25% increase in legal sales after the introduction of HADOPI for France, while there is no such effect in other countries with a similar pre-policy sales trend. Adermon and Liang (2014) find comparable results for IPRED, which increased post-policy sales by 36% and decreased piracy by 32% in Sweden, relative to Norway and Finland. Two of the main supply side interventions are the shutdown of the Megaupload and the UK site blocking, both of which have been implemented in 2012. The main difference between the two policies is that the former is a worldwide intervention, while the latter is restricted in the UK only. Danaher et al. (2015) suggest that global interventions, such as the Megaupload are more effective than national policies, such as the UK site blocking, which focus on a particular country or geographic region. \n\nThe Hargreaves (2011) report commissioned by the UK government, which is in harmony with earlier recommendations by the Gower’s review (2006), focuses on evidence related to enforcement and emphasizes: i) the need for market transactions to be faster, more automated and cheaper, in order to establish a UK digital copyright market which facilitates the resolution of disputes without costly litigation, ii) the demand for easier cross-border licensing in the EU. The report also acknowledges that small and medium size enterprises should have easier access at a lower cost to the court system and recommends the establishment of a small claims track for copyright to better resolve the many lower-value IP disputes emergencing from self-employed professionals and relatively small firms.\n\nCopyright enforcement is associated with large pecuniary costs from approximately £0.8m per year in Italy and £2.5m in the UK, to £5.6m in France and £12.7m per year in South Korea (see IPO, 2015). However, the evidence on copyright and economic activity is still inconclusive, perplexing the role of enforcement. For instance, Rob and Waldfogel (2006) and Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007), among others, suggest that there is no evidence that music or file downloading harms either the volume of sales or the quality of goods produced. According to Waldfogel (2012) an explanation might be that the digitization of the music industry brought not only piracy but also large reductions in the costs related to the production, distribution, and promotion of music, while it has also widened the market. This piece of evidence raises further considerations about copyright policy, the associated cost of enforcement and its welfare implications. \n\n\n''Evidence needed'' \n\nBoth the probability of being caught and the sanctions vary, even across comparable jurisdictions offering researchers a unique source of variation and allowing them to establish causal links between enforcement and other key variables of interest, such as sales, innovation and welfare. However, a common weakness in the existing literature and a key methodological challenge for future research is the inability to construct a convincingly appropriate control group to compare the results between treated and untreated countries. Several studies argue that they select two comparable countries, one of which implements an enforcement policy (treatment group), while the other does not (control group), and they evaluate the impact of the policy by contrasting variables of interest before and after the adoption of the intervention. Yet, there is generically a degree of arbitrariness associated with the selection of the reference or control country. One way to deal with such issues is the formation of a synthetic control group, which by construction deals with the appropriateness of the control group (a synthetic control group is comprised of different countries, which jointly form a group that is directly comparable to the treated country). Surprisingly enough, none of the existing studies on copyright follows this approach. \n\nAdditionally, in the digital age enforcement in one jurisdiction is likely to generate global spillover effects through the Internet. In the UK, for instance, IP crimes can be fined with up to £50,000 and lead to custodial sentence of up to 10 years (CDPA, 1988), while in other countries sanctions might be less or more severe. This disparity influences incentives and forces piracy to be organised in particular areas, while the derivative products can be easily distributed widely across the world. \n\nThere is some evidence from a small minority of countries on the effectiveness of different enforcement practices. For instance, stakeholders suggest that graduated response letters are relatively successful. As far as supply-side sanctions are concerned, evidence shows that making it easier, quicker and cheaper for rights holders to act against infringers is effective but also challenging. A key policy concern relates to the reflexes of enforcement authorities in response to changing technology, behaviour and legislation, as well as to the fact that so far reactions have been mainly therapeutic rather than preventive. \n\nDespite the significant progress made by some groups of researchers, such as the OHIM infringement observatory projects and the Ofcom/Kantar/IPO infringement tracker surveys, we still lack rigorous evidence and data related to copyright and users’ behaviour. In particular, there is an increasing demand for more data and evidence, from more countries and the use of new research methods for the design of future policies. Importantly, evidence-based policies require the identification of causal effects for particular policies and the examination of both direct and indirect welfare implications, as copyright enforcement is linked to innovation, privacy, civil liberties and freedom of speech, among others, which perplexes further the evaluation of policy effectiveness. \n\n\n''References''\n\nAdermon, A., & Liang, C.

Intellectual Property, 2.\n|Abstract=This report builds on previous work which estimated UK market sector investment in knowledge capital and its contribution to growth: the most recent example being the NESTA Innovation Index (Haskel et al, 2011). Knowledge capital investment adds to the stock of intellectual property (IP) in the economy. Not all that investment is protected by IP rights (IPRs) such as copyright and patents: software is protected, but business processes are not. Thus this paper attempts to answer the following questions: (a) what proportion of knowledge investment is protected by IPRs; and (b) how much economic growth is therefore accounted for by such protected investment?\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/310326/ipresearch-iprights-full-201107.pdf\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/310326/ipresearch-iprights-full-201107.pdf\n|Reference=Haskel, Clayton and Pesole (2009); Corrado, Goodridge and Haskel (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main findings of this study are: \n\n* On average, between 2000 and 2008, approximately 48% of UK market sector investment in knowledge was protected by IPRs.\n\n* Approximately 75% of IPR investment is in assets protected by copyright and unregistered design rights.\n\n* In 2008, approximately 62% of the stock of knowledge assets in the UK market sector were protected by IPRs.\n\n* On average, between 1990 and 2008, 10.6% of growth in labour productivity was due to growth in the use of IPR-protected assets, similar to the 11.1% contribution of ICT equipment. The contribution of knowledge capital not protected by IPRs is around 10.3%, slightly less than that of protected IPRs.\n\n* We view our results as a lower bound of the total contribution of IPR-protected assets. Patents protect a specific innovation but reveal information to others for free. The same is true for other forms of IPR-protected knowledge. Such freely available information contributes to growth via total factor productivity (TFP) - effects on total output not caused by inputs -, which we estimate contributes around 45% of labour productivity growth. Thus the true contribution of IPRs would include a share of this.\n|FundamentalIssue=1. Relationship between protection (subject matter/term/scope) and supply/economic development/growth/welfare, 4.

(2008). Norms-based intellectual property systems: The case of French chefs. Organization Science, 19(2), 187-201.\n|Abstract=In this paper we propose that “norms-based” intellectual property systems exist today, and are an important complement to or substitute for law-based intellectual property systems. Norms-based IP systems, as we define them, operate entirely upon the basis of implicit social norms that are held in common by members of a given community. Within that community, they offer functionality “similar to” contemporary law-based IP systems with respect to both the nature of rights protected and the effectiveness of protection provided.\n\nWe document the existence of a norms-based IP system among a sample of accomplished French chefs. These chefs consider recipes they develop to be a very valuable form of intellectual property. At the same time, recipes are not a form of innovation that is effectively covered by law-based intellectual property systems. Via grounded research, we identify three strong implicit social norms related to the protection of recipe IP. Via quantitative research, we find that accomplished chefs enforce these norms, and apply them in ways that enhance their private economic returns from their recipe-related IP.\n\nIn our discussion, we compare the attributes of norms-based and law-based IP systems, arguing that each has different advantages and drawbacks. We also point out that the existence of norms-based IP systems means that many “information commons” may prove to be criss-crossed by norms-based fences, with community access controlled by community IP owners.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0314?journalCode=orsc\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=881781\n|Reference=Allen (1983); Bernstein (1992); Rosamond (2002); Strandbourg (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of study:\n\n*Three major social norms consistently emerged in all our interviews with chefs. First, it is not honorable for chefs to exactly copy recipes developed by other chefs. Chefs were vehement about how very wrong it was to copy the recipe of a colleague. \n\n*The second important norm is that a chef who asks for and is given proprietary information by a colleague will not pass that information on to others without permission. This norm applies only to information that can be kept as a trade secret if not revealed. The requirement to not pass it on is important but is generally not stated when information is transferred in response to a request—it is implicit.\n\n*The third norm involves the right to be acknowledged as the author of a recipe one has created. This applies to a recipe that one may observe at a creator’s restaurant or ask the developer about; it also applies when the innovator publicly reveals his recipe by, for example, publishing it in a cookbook or a magazine or describing it on TV. This norm offers a functionality offered by copyright and by law on the “moral rights” of authors and artists to have the paternity of their work acknowledged.\n\n*The quantitative element of the research is designed to explore two matters: (1) whether the norms identified via grounded research are actually being enforced by chefs, and (2) whether chefs are enforcing the norms in a way likely to increase their private innovation-related profits. \n\n*IP holders were significantly more likely to deny secret IP to requesters they thought likely to violate each of the three social norms. We also found that this association was strongest when information of high value was being requested.\n\n*The decision to provide or withhold IP is in the hands of the chef holding that IP and is related to his or her perceptions of the attributes of the information seeker, not to the actual attributes of that person.\n\n*The authors found that chefs who selectively reveal recipe-related information to a colleague appear to be engaging in informal information trading rather than altruism. Chefs were more likely to present high-value recipe information in a public forum. In sharp contrast, they were significantly more likely to reveal low-value information privately to anyone who asked.\n\n*When asked why they would reveal some of their recipes to the public at large, the chefs tended to agree with the motives listed that clearly involved direct personal gain in the form of increased restaurant sales and enhanced personal reputations. \n\n*Having documented that accomplished French chefs both espouse and enforce IP-related norms, the authors conclude that a norms-based IP system exists among French chefs.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Licensing and Business models (collecting societies; meta data; exchanges/hubs; windowing; crossborder availability),\n|Discipline=A14: Sociology of Economics, K: Law and Economics, O34: Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital\n|Intervention-Response=Policy implications:\n\n*If norms-based IP systems are effective and common in today’s economies, clearly a great deal of research is needed to better understand them. We propose that it will be useful to study norms-based IP systems further and to learn how they can most usefully be applied to serve both innova- tors and society.\n\n*In addition to research to determine the ubiquity and economic importance of norms-based IP systems, it would be very useful to understand the extent to which the norms that underlie such systems are similar.\n\n*It will also be useful to more deeply explore whether one system tends to dominate the other when both are present.\n|Description of Data=Data was collected in two phases: \n\n*First, the authors conducted grounded field research to identify important social norms dealing with recipe-related IP. \n\n*Second, they conducted a quantitative, questionnaire-based study to determine whether innovators deployed social norms to gain private economic advantage and whether violators of the norms were in fact sanctioned by accomplished haute cuisine chefs.\n\n*The samples for both studies consisted of the chefs de cuisine in restaurants that had received “stars” and/or “forks” from the Michelin guide as a sign of culinary excellence. \n\n*In the first phase, requests for a meeting were made to 12 chefs, and 10 responded positively. Seven of these were interviewed face to face, and three were inter- viewed by email. Seven of the 10 chefs interviewed had Michelin stars. Three had no stars but were listed in the Michelin guide as chefs de cuisine in “good gastronomic restaurants.”\n\n*In the second phase, questionnaires were sent to chefs who had been recognized in the Michelin guide. These included chefs holding stars, “rising stars,” and chefs holding from 2 to 5 forks. Of 485 questionnaires sent, 104 were returned, a response rate of 21.4%. Of these, 10 contained essentially no data and so were not included in our analyses. The 94 analyzable questionnaires were reasonably well distributed across the expertise categories in the Michelin guide: 7% came from two-star chefs, 62% from one- star chefs, 3% from rising stars, and 28% from chefs awarded forks.\n|Data Year=Not stated.\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences), Semi-Structured Interview\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Qualitative Analysis Methods, Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data)\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=France;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None stated;\n|Method=Mixed methods, interviews, survey\n|Data=survey with n=75 chefs, qualitative interviews\n|Proposition=In the absence of protectability, French Chefs have developed a norms-based regulation system for recipes which resembles IP law\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

International Journal of Law and Information Technology, 19(4), 306-323\n|Abstract=Technological protection measures (TPMs) are the hard core of digital rights management (DRM) systems, which enforce the rights of the copyright owner in the digital environment. Copyright scholars expressed concerns that TPMs do not comply with copyright exceptions and limits (Hugenholtz 2000; Koelman 2000; Dusollier 2003; Westkamp 2004). A few solutions to this problem have been proposed in the field of internet services (Mulligan and Burstein 2002; Erickson 2003; Cohen and Burk 2001; Sobel 2003). However, none of these proposals is tailored to optical disks (CDs and DVDs). Yet, the report ‘Digital Broadband Content: Music’ of the OECD (2005) states that TPMs implemented on optical disks hinder copyright exceptions more often than those applied to internet services. Moreover, in Europe the Copyright Directive exempts TPMs implemented on internet services from compliance with copyright exceptions. This paper therefore outlines possible ways to implement TPMs on optical disks in Europe, in order to achieve their compliance with a list of fundamental copyright exceptions, as identified by previous research (Favale 2008).\n|Authentic Link=http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/08/04/ijlit.ear010.abstract\n|Reference=Hugenholtz (2000); Favale (2008); Westkamp (2004); Mulligan and Burstein (2002); Sobel (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Achieving a compliant DRM system harmonized at international level seems impossible in the light of the current state of the art.\n\n* Law is complex, articulated and unstable (subject to interpretations). When instructions are dictated by law, therefore, the gap between human-readable and machine-readable languages enlarges significantly. Approximation is therefore crucial to ‘streamline’ legal norms\n\n* To date no technical locks on optical disks (or on digital products on different carriers) have been implemented with the declared intent to comply with copyright exceptions.\n\n* With little modification, legal and technological instruments are already available to develop TPMs complying with copyright exceptions.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

This paper suggests that achieving interoperability among carriers and fine-tuning copy-controlling TPMs would already get us very far down this road.\n\n* Other legal systems like the American, for example, could also develop similar models. To this end, they preliminarily need to identify a number of instances of fair use, possibly with the help of a third party\n\n* Approximation should consistently follow a rule in favour of the user. This seems more coherent with the ultimate goal of copyright protection: the circulation of culture and knowledge. \n\n*Approximation should be inversely proportional to the technological state of the art: more sophisticated DRM system would require less and less approximation.\n|Description of Data=Alongside a literature review of works suggesting implementation of copyright exceptions in DRM, the author proposes a rule-set to be embodied and suggests a model of implementation based on a) a list of Primary Actors; b) a list of ‘Actions’ that each actor might be willing to perform; c) a list of machine-readable ‘Actions’ that have to be embedded in compliant TPMs.\n|Data Year=Non stated\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Literature review;\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Case Study, Document Research\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Analysis Methods, Textual Content Analysis\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games); Sound recording and music publishing; Television programmes; Film and motion pictures; Computer programming;\n|Country=United Kingdom; European Union; United States;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=Yes\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=1\n|Level of Aggregation=Rule-set,\n|Data Material Year=Non stated\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=1\n|Level of Aggregation=Implementation model,\n|Data Material Year=Non stated\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2544, 'title': 'Favale, M', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2545, 'title': 'Favale, Homberg, Kretschmer, Mendis and Secchi (2013)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Favale, Homberg, Kretschmer, Mendis and Secchi (2013)\n|Author=Favale, M; Homberg, F; Kretschmer, M; Mendis, D; Secchi, D\n|Title=Copyright and the regulation of orphan works.

Study I undertook a comparative international review of\nactual or proposed orphan works legislation, and identified key characteristics of orphan works\nlicensing schemes. Study II investigated the potential effects of such schemes by conducting a\nsimulated rights clearance exercise for six scenarios (establishing licence terms and fees for\nspecific commercial and non-commercial uses), and analysing the resulting dataset for effects\nof the characteristics identified in Study I.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/copyright-and-the-regulation-of-orphan-works\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312779/ipresearch-orphan-201307.pdf\n|Reference=Hargreaves (2011); De Beer and Bouchard (2010); Gowers (2006); US Register of Copyrights (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Two distinct approaches appear to be used for governing orphan works in the jurisdictions by collecting societies in Denmark. Interestingly, national central authorities have claimed that although no official negotiation process is provided by law, the price of licences is set on a case by case basis, after considering the individual circumstances of the applicant\n\n*  In Canada, Japan, India, Denmark and France an upfront payment is normally required by the applicant in exchange for using orphan works. In Canada, payment is upfront in approximately two-thirds of cases, whilst it is contingent on the rightholder reappearing in the remaining third.\n\n* In the US, in Hungary, and France a voluntary public online register for suspected orphan works is established. The EU is establishing a register at the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM). In Japan, some institutions have their own register of orphan works. No register is envisaged in India, Canada or Denmark (prior to the Orphan Works Directive). \n\n* There does not appear to be a standard price for licensing orphan works. \n\n* There is no systematic recognition of what may constitute an appropriate duration for licences.\n\n*  The report finds high tariffs that discourage mass digitisation projects. \n\n* The average level of fees imposed on a potential user of an orphan work is similar in collective and individual licensing regimes.\n\n*  A limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works, enabling those organisations to share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, the up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts, guaranteeing that a reappearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of any work.\n\n* The incentive problem is not mere speculation but reflected in actual user behaviour and shows that in particular in the US a limited liability system seems to enhance the availability of orphan works.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

This implies that the associated cost with running collective and individual licensing systems may become an important criterion when implementing a new solution for the regulation of orphan works.\n\n*  According to the authors, a legislator must make a decision on what is deemed to be the desired behaviour. Thus, it seems feasible to consider both the limited liability and the up-front rights clearing as viable options but for different purposes. The limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works enabling those organisations to actually share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts guaranteeing that a re-appearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of their work.\n|Description of Data=Study I consists of a comparative international review of actual or proposed orphan works legislation.

A  particular emphasis  was placed  on  the  importance  of  cultural  and  risk  aspect  in  music piracy in  this  paper. It  takes  into account a large sample of micro - level behavioral data of university students from the U.S. and Switzerland. We show that  despite  the  fact  that  these  countries  are  two  western, industrialized and  technologically  advanced nations, students have differences  in  national  cultureand they view  and  treat  copyright  differently,  which ultimately affects the propensity to engage in music piracy.Our results show that consumer behavior can differ even  among  developed  and  technologically  advanced  countries.We  show  that  compared  to  Swiss  students, American  students  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  music  piracy. With  respect  to  the  demographic  factors,  male students are more prone to piracy, whereas older students are less likely to engage in such activity. Finally, the key risk variables perceived probability of getting caught when conducting such illegal activity and the resulting penalty to be paid are negatively associated with music piracy behavior.This paper provides important insights which can be used to have tailored policies to alleviate piracy behavior in each country.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jecr.org/node/122\n|Reference=Chiang and Assane (2007); Rapp and Rozek (1990); Rawlinson and Lupton (2007); Shore et al (2001); Chen and Png (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The   paper identified   four   categories of   factors:   economic, demographic,  risk,  and  culture,  that are  hypothesized  to influence consumer  behavior with  respect  to  music piracy.

(2012). The Circulations of Culture-On Social Distribution of Content. Warsaw School of Social Sciences and Humanities: September 1st, 2012. Available at SSRN 2246508.\n|Abstract=The report “Circulations of Culture. Social Distribution of Content” is an attempt at \nanalyzing the phenomenon of informal cultural content sharing in Poland. It describes \nhow books, music, and movies circulate among Poles who sometimes buy them, but more often than not acquire them via the Internet and borrow or copy them from friends. We focused our study on the comparison of formal and informal circulations of cultural content, in the form of either digital or cultural copies. We decided not to \nstudy broadcast media use, due to the lack of circulating copies that allow comparisons with informal circulations online. \nYet the public discussion, revolving around file sharing networks and more broadly \naround obtaining and making use of cultural content in a digital form, usually situates these practices on the margin of typical activities of Poles. Such practices still seem to be –as they are described in the public discussion- an embarrassing subject; stigmatized as an illegal activity that hurts legal content markets, creators, and intermediaries. \nWe conducted this research study in order to provide this public debate with an \nempirically absed descriptuon of the circulations of content in digital form and \nforemost on the Internet. And also to show the cultural and social aspects of this \nphenomenon that go beyond the question of its legality. First and foremost, we seek \nto explain why informal circulations of culture in digital form are an important issue for research on contemporary culture. Secondly, we stress that exploration into this issue provides important evidence for cultural policy.\nThe goal of our project was purely exploratory – instead of making rigid assumptionsin order to verify them, we decided to analyze the answers that the respondents put down in the questionnaires, their attitudes, and the opinions they expressed. This approach sought to help us understand how often, in what way, and why \nPoles engage with informal content circulations. \nMost importantly, we chose not to distinguish nor discriminate between legal and\nillegal circulations – mainly because the border between the two is often fuzzy and \nunclear for people who participate in either of them. Therefore, this is not a report \nabout “pirates” that conduct illegal activities, but rather about people who engage in informal content sharing practices. \nBut abandoning the simple legal-illegal binary has yet another reason. The goal of this report is to foster real dialogue on the issue of acquiring cultural content in Poland. The overuse of labels such as “piracy” or “theft” will not improve the chances of establishing such dialogue. An opposition between “formal” and “informal” is in our opinion a much better way for framing this debate.\nWe conducted a quantitative, survey study and one of our primary goal was to \nestablish the scale and general character of the informal content circulation –\nespecially the distribution of digital formats. The project consisted of two surveys. The first one, a pilot survey, was conducted through computer-assisted personal \ninterviews between May 19 and May 26 of 2011 on a sample of 1004 people over 15 \nyears of age, which was representative for the Polish population. \nThe goal of this survey was to describe the scale and basic characteristics of informal circulation in the whole Polish society. We were in particular interested in differences between Internet users and non-users, and between age groups. \nThe second survey was conducted over the Internet through computer-assisted web interviewson a sample of 1283 people. The survey was conducted on a random \nnationwide sample and the demographic structure of the analyzed set was representative of the Polish Internet user population (according to Nettrack) with \nrespect to gender, age (16 to 50 years old), place of residence, and education. \nWe have focused upon the population of Internet users based on the results of the first survey, according to which non-users do not participate in circulations of digital content.\n|Authentic Link=http://obiegikultury.centrumcyfrowe.pl/en\n|Link=http://obiegikultury.centrumcyfrowe.pl/the_circulations_of_culture_report.pdf\n|Reference=Svensson and Larsson (2009); Lessig (2005); Ciemniewski (2009); Manovich (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Principal conclusions of the report:\n\n*13% of Poles purchase content, as opposed to 33% that obtain it through informal, digital circulations. Only 13% of Poles have purchased a book, a movie, or a musical recording in the year before the survey. Informal circulation is the second source of cultural content with the broadcast mass media like radio and TV being the first. The informal sphere covers 39% of Poles – thus being three times as large as the market-bound circulation of cultural content. \n\n*Engaging with the informal circulations of digital content strongly correlates with age. We should assume that populations ages 40 and older do not participate in smaller circulation of digital content.\n\n*The survey did not corroborate the thesis about informal circulations supplanting the formal ones. The people who most actively engage in the informal content circulations (i.e. Internet users who download files) constitute the largest segment of the purchasers. They comprise 32% of all people purchasing books, 31% of all people purchasing movies, and over half of all people who buy music. The 15 to 24 age group made up the biggest part of the group of people that both purchase content and download it from the Internet – despite common assumptions that younger generations lack funds to purchase content. \n\n*A quarter of all Poles engage with the informal circulation without purchasing any content from the formal circulations. Membership in this group is strongly linked  with age – the percentage of such people is much higher in the younger age groups,  while significantly dropping off in age groups over 50. \n\n*62% of Poles do not participate in either the formal or the informal circulations of cultural content. The primary form of cultural activity for most Poles is probably watching television and listening to the radio. \n\n*The average Internet user buys three times more books and movies and seven times more music in comparison with people who don’t use the Internet. Internet usage is the primary distinguishing factor when it comes to interest in cultural content, which is furthercorrelated with age and education. More importantly, these differences are even more pronounced where accessing content doesn’t require any financial commitment, such as borrowing books, movies, or music. \n\n*Active Internet users are a group especially inclined to participate in circulations of culture. Strong differences are revealed when Internet users are split into less active and more active ones: 88% of active Internet users participate in the informal circulation of music, 73% participate in informal book circulation, and 78% engage in informal movie circulation (in the three months preceding the survey). 72% of active internet users claim to have downloaded files from the Internet – e.g. from file-sharing networks or from file hosting services. \n\n*92% of active users claim to have engaged in informal circulations if their definition is expanded to include all avenues of content access (such as streaming, sharing files with friends, etc.). If we include the informal circulation of content stored on physical media (e.g. sharing and copying books or CDs and DVDs) in the aforementioned definition, then practically all of the respondents (95%) claim to have engaged in such content circulations. \n\n*75% of active internet users indicated price and a wider selection of content available on the Internet as justifications for their behavior. Two-thirds of them pointed to such factors as availability without delays (typical of formal circulations, where global content arrives in Poland often with a delay) or the selection available.\n\n*Internet distribution impacts the way active internet users interact and use media formats. Only 8% of people who download music from the Internet download entire albums only; 31% download both albums and single files, while 61% download strictly single audio files. \n\n*The most commonplace attitude of active Internet users (50% of respondents) towards the informal circulations is moderate and focused on the broadening of cultural horizons. For them, the crucial factor is the ability to know more and see more, not acquire free content. \n\n*Additionally, two countervailing attitudes exist between fans of the informal circulation (8%), who think that “everyone’s downloading content,” and its staunchest critics (11%), who claim that downloading is theft and that the law should be more stringent with people who acquire content from the Internet via illegal means. \n\n*A fourth group (13%) claims that “downloading is simply easier.” Interestingly, prices do not discourage them from acquiring content from the formal circulations, but rather the inconvenience of using the formal channels, that are not present when engaging the informal ones.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

If we do, then we will arrive at the conclusion that this substitution is furthered not only by the negatively-branded Internet phenomena, but also by the commonplace sharing of  content in the household, and even the activity of public cultural institutions, the latter also enabling us to access content via non-market means. \n\n*We’re already facing situations where access to content that’s allowed from the standpoint of the Polish legal system is hindered by technological instruments. The state, with its instruments that are supposed to regulate that sphere, has to look for balance between the interest of copyright owners and the public good. Favoring either side of the issue is completely unacceptable. \n\n*Cultural policy should be based on the assumption that multiple content circulations can coexist and might frequently overlap. And the goal of cultural policy should be the establishment of institutions and cultural frameworks that will harness these various circulations to foster creativity, as well as the possibility to use it, while remaining grounded in facts and considering the arguments of all involved parties.\n|Description of Data=The project consisted of two surveys. \n\nThe first one was a nationwide pilot survey based on computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), conducted from May 19 to May 26 of 2011 by Millward Brown SMG KRC company, on a representative sample of 1004 persons over 15 years of age. \n\nThe second survey took a deeper look into the mechanisms of acquiring and recommending content. It was conducted on the Internet, based on computer assisted \nweb interviewing (CAWI), and included only respondents who were Internet users. The sample consisted of 1283 people. The study was conducted between 20th September and 2nd October 2011. The identity of all respondents was confirmed offline at an earlier date (they were recruited during personal interviews). To take part in the research, the respondent had to have an Internet connection in their household and use the \nInternet and email at least a few times every week. Respondents received remuneration for time spent on filling out the survey. The research was conducted on a random, nationwide sample, and the demographic structure of the analyzed set is representative for the population of Polish Internet users (according to Nettrack results) with regard to gender, age (16 to 50 years old), place of residence, and education. Given our earlier assumptions about age and the limitations of methodology (online) we can assume that we’ve covered 25% of the Polish population from a demographic standpoint, and about 45% of Internet users from the 15 to 50 age group.\n|Data Year=May 19 - May 26, 2011; September 20 - October 2, 2011\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association, Multivariate Statistics, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Software publishing (including video games); Film and motion pictures; Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=Poland;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=Polish National Center for Culture (NCK); SMG KRC Millward  Brown; National Audiovisual Institute (NINA);\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1465, 'title': 'Fiesler, Feuston and Bruckman (2015)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Fiesler, Feuston and Bruckman (2015)\n|Author=Fiesler, C.; Fesuton, J.; Bruckman, A.\n|Title=Understanding Copyright Law in Online Creative Communities\n|Year=2015\n|Full Citation=Fiesler, C., Feuston, J.

ACM.\n|Abstract=Copyright law is increasingly relevant to everyday interactions online, from social media status updates to artists showcasing their work. This is especially true in creative spaces where rules about reuse and remix are notoriously gray. Based on a content analysis of public forum postings in eight different online communities featuring different media types (music, video, art, and writing), we found that copyright is a frequent topic of conversation and that much of this discourse stems from problems that copyright causes for creative activities. We identify the major types of problems encountered, including chilling effects that negatively impact technology use. We find that many challenges can be explained by lack of knowledge about legal or policy rules, including breakdowns in user expectations for the sites they use. We argue that lack of clarity is a pervasive usability problem that should be considered more carefully in the design of user-generated content platforms.\n|Authentic Link=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2675234\n|Reference=Bruckman (2002); Auferheide, Jaszi, and Brown (2007); Auferheide and Jaszi (2011); Fiesler (2013); Fiesler and Bruckman (2014);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* One clear theme that emerged was the prevalence of problems related to copyright expressed by creators in these conversations. Most of the posts in the data set could be labeled as expressing some sort of problem. Five major types were identified:\n# avoiding trouble,\n# dealing with consequences,\n# fear of infringement,\n# dealing with infringement, and\n# incomplete information.\n* A common problem directly expressed by these creators is worry over whether something they are doing might be infringing someone else’s copyright. Many of the posts are essentially asking “Is this going to get me into trouble?” or “How can I avoid getting into trouble?”\n* Many of the posters also note that they researched the issue first themselves and were confused by the law or unable to find satisfactory answers.\n* With regard to authors, posters often express frustration that there isn’t more that they can do to protect their work—for example, that the site moderators aren’t doing enough or that the site’s policies aren’t effective, sometimes making suggestions for policy or workflow changes.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

There are many stakeholders with competing interests—lawmakers, copyright holders, online content creators, content consumers. However, technologies and websites that facilitate creation and sharing are also part of this environment and should be considering these issues in terms of both usability and design \n* This study reveals that it is an important aspect of interactions between creators in these online communities, and therefore should be an important part of the user model in design decisions. We should not only be thinking of ways to help creators better understand copyright, but also considering the implications of the ways they currently understand it as well.\n|Description of Data=Researchers targeted online communities that for art, music, video, and writing media types and selected two sites for each media type based on their user-generated content and active public forums. \n\nResearchers scraped public forum posts associated with these online communities and collected the content as well as the header information. They then performed searches for posts focused on copyright and relevant conversations that did not include the word. Using a sample of 200 posts from these online communities, the researchers pulled out common related terms in order to create a comprehensive set of keyword to search for conversations about copyright. The final list of keywords included: attorney, copyright, copy, copying, illegal, infringement, lawyer, legal, license, permission, plagiarism, plagiarist, rights, steal, stole, and trademark. \n\nBased on those keywords, another scrape was performed resulting in nearly 100,000 total posts across eight different forums. A maximum of 50 posts were collected from each site, though some had less than 50 as their total number of posts about copyright. \n\nThe final data set has a total of 339 forum posts.\n|Data Year=Spring 2013\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative data/text mining\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Analysis Methods, Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data), Grounded Theory\n|Industry=Film and motion pictures; Creative, arts and entertainment; Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=United States;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=Not stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=339\n|Level of Aggregation=Forum posts,\n|Data Material Year=Not stated\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1494, 'title': 'Fetscherin (2005)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Fetscherin (2005)\n|Author=Fetscherin, M.;\n|Title=Movie piracy on peer-to-peer networks—the case of KaZaA\n|Year=2005\n|Full Citation=Fetscherin, M. (2005). Movie piracy on peer-to-peer networks—the case of KaZaA. Telematics and Informatics, 22(1), 57-70.\n|Abstract=Content providers from the movie industry argue that peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as KaZaA, Morpheus, or Audiogalaxy are an enormous threat to their business. They blame these networks for their recent decline in sales figures. However, this argument would only apply if consumers can access high quality copies easily and quickly on these networks. This paper presents a simple model outlining the consumers tradeoff between downloading the movie legally or acquiring it illegally through copying from such networks. The model shows that there are mainly two factors affecting consumer demand for copies: the probability of getting high quality copies and the risk associated with copying. The paper goes on to empirically estimate the probability of getting such high quality copies. To date, our results show that there is a very low probability of obtaining high quality movies. We further tested our model by conducting simulation analyses to better understand current and future consumer behavior. The first simulation shows that, with the current low probability of getting high quality copies, the majority of consumers would prefer to download movies legally. The results of the second simulation focusing on the future behavior of consumers showing that the most important factors are: the risk of being caught, the perceived value of the original, the availability (probability) of high quality copies and the price of the original. Our research findings not only offer insight into the consumer behavior, but also to what extent the movie industry faces piracy. These results may serve as a new impulse for copyright holders and policy makers, allowing them to make appropriate decisions and take targeted actions to fight piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585304000437\n|Reference=(Holm, 2000); Fetscherin (2003); Hui and Png (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This paper presents a simple model of consumers tradeoff between buying and copying.

Determinants of Unlawful Product Acquisition. CREATe Working Paper No 1 (January 2016).\n|Abstract=We present a laboratory experiment that systematically investigates the determinants of acquisition behavior with a negative externality on a rights holder. We consider social and moral determinants of unlawful behavior as well as standard penalty and punishment risk trade-offs. We find that, while punishment risk and penalty size reduce unlawful behavior, they are not the only determinants that do. Moral determinants matter: there being a victim, and the victim deserving to be the rights holder, makes a difference. Social norms also matter: controlling for other variables, one point more of social appropriateness increase unlawful behavior by around 30-40%.\n|Authentic Link=https://zenodo.org/record/44378/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2016-01.pdf\n|Link=https://zenodo.org/record/44378/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2016-01.pdf\n|Reference=Watson, Zizzo and Fleming (2015); Becker (1968);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study examines the determinants of unlawful product acquisition. In particular, this paper explores the factors influencing the negative externality acquisition behavior (NEAB) and test the following hypotheses in a lab experiment.\n\nHypotheses:\n* H1 (risk trade-off): Unlawful product acquisition decreases when the punishment probability increases.\n* H2 (penalty trade-off): Unlawful product acquisition is lower in the tasks with high penalty (£18) than in those in which the amount of the penalty is lower (£6).\nThe following hypotheses follow respectively from our discussion of victimless crimes, high or low marginal damage, wealth and perceived deservingness of the rights holder:\n* H3 (victimless behavior): The presence of a rights holder reduces risk taking that damages him or her relative to an equivalent neutrally framed risk taking task.\n* H4 (low vs high marginal damage): Unlawful product acquisition is higher in the treatments in which the number of consumers per rights holder is higher (10) and the rights holder’s profit is lower (10%) than in those in which the number of consumers is lower (2) and the rights holder’s profit is higher (50%).\n* H5 (wealth): Unlawful product acquisition is higher in the tasks where the rights holder has a high endowment (£22) than in the tasks in which the rights holder has a low endowment (£4).\n* H6 (deservingness): Unlawful product acquisition is lower in the treatments where the rights holder has exerted effort than in the treatments in which the rights holder has exerted no effort.\nThe moral scenario analysis is more exploratory and we do not formulate explicit hypotheses, though it would be reasonable to assume that Kantians should be more law/rule abiding, that one such rule would be not to harm others, and as a result they would be less likely to engage in NEAB.\nIn relation to the social determinants of NEAB, there is a clear prediction:\n* H7 (social norms): NEAB is predicted by observers’ opinion about the social appropriateness of unlawful product acquisition in a particular task/treatment.\n\nResults:\n* H1 is supported. NEAB becomes less frequent when the punishment probability increases.\n* H2 is supported. NEAB is lower when the penalty is higher.\n* H3 is supported. Framing the task in terms of having a victim that is affected by NEAB reduces risky choices relative to purely risky choice tasks.\n* There is almost no evidence for H4, i.e. a low or high marginal return to the rights holder do not seem to matter.\n* H5 is not supported. The probability of consumers engaging in unlawful product acquisition is not higher in the tasks where the rights holder has high wealth (£22) than in the tasks in which the rights holder has low wealth (£4).\n* H6 is supported. The probability of the consumer engaging in unlawful product acquisition is lower in the conditions where the rights holder has exerted effort than in the treatments in which the rights holder has exerted no effort. Consumers care about deservingness to some degree.\n* H7 is strongly supported. Unlawful product acquisition is predicted by social norms, as measured by the Observers’ opinion about the social appropriateness of unlawful product acquisition in a particular task/treatment.\n* Utilitarian-minded subjects may engage less in NEAB.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

An exploratory study on the factors associated with ethical intention of digital piracy (Doctoral dissertation, Nova Southeastern University).\n|Abstract=Each year billions of dollars are lost due to illegal downloading and copying of intellectual property. Individuals often perceive little or no consequences as a result of digital piracy. Research has shown that perceived consequences could be used to alter an individual's ethical intention to engage in digital piracy (INT). In addition subjective norm (SUN) may also contribute to INT. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the factors of perceived consequences and to assess their contribution, as well as the contribution of SUN, to INT.\nThis predictive study developed a quantitative instrument to measure the contribution of the factors of perceived consequences and SUN on INT. In phase one of this study, an anonymous exploratory questionnaire was used to gather a list of perceived consequences. That list was combined with a list of perceived consequences found through an extensive review of the literature and a survey instrument was developed and used in phase two. After data cleaning, a total of 407 responses remained. Exploratory factor analysis incorporating principal component analysis (PCA) identified eight factors of INT: Personal Emotional Consequences (PEC), Freedom Consequences (FRC), Minor Consequences (MIC), Personal Freedom Consequences (PFC), Personal Moral Consequences (PMC), Network Access Consequences (NAC), Self Worth Consequences (SWC), and Industry Financial Consequences (IFC). A model was developed using Ordinal Logistic Regression to determine the contribution of the eight factors of perceived consequences and SUN on INT.\nPEC, PMC, and IFC as well as SUN were found to be significant contributors to INT. The Mann-Whitney U test determined that INT was the only factor that showed a significant difference for males. Additionally, gender was a significant contributor to FRC, MIC, PFC, PMC, SWC, and IFC. Each of these factors was more significant for females than males. The Kruskal-Wallis test determined that there were no significant differences in the factors of perceived consequences, SUN, and INT based on age or computer usage. Important contributions of this study include the identification of eight perceived consequence factors not previously known as well as the development of a unified predictive model, addressing all forms of digital piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1357291461.1669out20.pdf\n|Link=http://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1357291461.1669out20.pdf\n|Reference=Gopal, Sanders, Bhattacharjee, Agrawal, Wagner (2004); Gupta, Gould, Pola (2004); Sundarajan (2004); Gopal and Sanders (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results reported by this study: \n\n*The eight factors of perceived consequences that contribute to ethical intention to engage in digital piracy were named Personal Emotional Consequences (PEC), Freedom Consequences (FRC), Minor Consequences (MIC), Personal Freedom Consequences (PFC), Personal Moral Consequences (PMC), Network Access Consequences (NAC), Self Worth Consequences (SWC), and Industry Financial Consequences (IFC). \n\n*The results of this study indicate that Personal Emotional Consequences, Personal Moral Consequences, and Industry Financial Consequences are the factors that contribute to intention to engage in digital piracy. \n\n*Prior research has been inconclusive regarding gender and INT, but the results of this study indicate that gender is significant in its contribution to intention to engage in digital piracy. Intention to engage in digital piracy was the only variable that resulted in higher significance for male participants than for females indicating that ethical intention has less bearing on males’ likelihood of engaging in digital piracy. \n\n*The factors Freedom Consequences, Minor Consequences, Personal Freedom Consequences, Personal Moral Consequences, Self Worth Consequences, and Industry Financial Consequences were found to have higher significance for female participants than males. These results indicate that the perception of these factors may be what deters females from engaging in digital piracy.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Available at SSRN 2407145.\n|Abstract=In a recent and unpublished study — Empirical Copyright: A Case Study of File Sharing and Music Output — Tulane University Law Professor Glynn Lunney, Jr., concludes that “file sharing has not reduced the creation of new original music.” The claim is based on the correlation of music sales over time to the appearance of “new artists”, narrowly defined, appearing at the top of BILLBOARD’s Hot 100 chart. In this PERSPECTIVE, I provide a review of Dr. Lunney’s paper. Unfortunately, the empirical analysis in Dr. Lunney’s paper is some of the weakest in this area, and the defects in the analysis are many and varied. Put plainly, his statistical analysis is inexpertly performed; the empirical model is poorly motivated, poorly designed, and improperly estimated. Moreover, contrary to his claim, his results do not support his theory. Alternative and more plausible interpretations of Professor Lunney’s results suggest piracy has the expected negative consequences on the creative industries.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2407145\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2407145\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003); Luckerson (2012); Liebowitz (2013); Lunney (2014);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* As the copyright review debate heats up, so will the amount of academic research on the effects of copyright, piracy, fair use, and other relevant concepts. Given the importance of intellectual property, it is vital that any research used to formulate policy be subjected to close scrutiny.\n\n* In this perspective, this study reviews a recent paper on the effects of piracy on the music industry by Professor Glynn Lunney which purports to show that “file sharing has not reduced the creation of new original music.”\n\n* The author claims that, not only is Professor Lunney's unsupported, but her analysis suffers from defects so severe as to render it useless for guiding public policy.\n\n* Furthermore, copyright is established in the U.S. Constitution on the theory that one obtains more goods and services when one pays for them. Those opposed to copyright on whatever grounds, the author claims, surely bear a substantial burden in making their case.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

This report examines the demographic, spending and behavioural patterns of the Vuze user in comparison with with those of the general internet user across a range of platform technologies. Comparative conclusions are reached across various datasets, including: demographic profiles, spending power, spending patterns, propensity for consumption of certain media, behavioural tendencies and the ability of Vuze users to influence the behaviour of others. The Vuze audience profile is slightly younger than that of the general internet, but still has an equal share of high income households.￼ Vuze users are also leading the way in consuming and adopting new media technologies across multiple platforms. Furthermore, it is concluded that Vuze users lead opinion formation on technology and have the power to disseminate same across large social circles.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.magid.com/sites/default/files/pdf/vuze.pdf\n|Reference=Foreman (2014);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The demographic, behavioural and spending patterns of users of file sharing application Vuze show a significant extent of disparity when compared to those of the general internet user.  The profile variables chosen by the study reveal a significant relationship contrast between the two groups, with the Vuze audience having a propensity for consumption of online media and the acquisition of new media technologies. The results of the study showed that the Vuze audience:\n\n* Skews slightly younger than the general internet, but still has an equal share of high income households;\n\n* Purchase more movie tickets, DVDs, and rentals than general internet users; \n\n* Are early adopters of new technology; \n\n* Tend to spend on HDTVs, newer and more expensive computers with bigger screens, and the latest device technology;\n\n* Spend more time watching online video; \n\n* Are more socially connected; \n\n* Are at the forefront of new technology purchases; \n\n* Influence the purchasing decisions of the general internet user.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The results show that although approximately 40% of surveyed users know how to download and play pirated video games for free, most of them do not actually download pirated versions. Furthermore, no significantly negative relationship can be found between downloading pirated video games and purchasing the original versions.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1828642\n|Reference=Hui and Png (2003); Tanaka (2004); Zetner (2006); Liebowitz (2007); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The study used questionnaire survey data to define how actively two groups of users of portable video game machines (the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS) downloaded pirate video games and purchased genuine versions. Several significant findings were made to codify the extent of user knowledge in acquiring pirate versions of the games and if there were correlative effect on propensity to purchase genuine versions as follows: \n\n*  40% of surveyed users of the Nintendo and Sony platforms know how to download and play pirated video games for free; \n\n* Only 5% of users that know how to download pirated versions of the games actually do so; \n\n* 70% of users that knew how to download and play pirated video games, but did not do so, explained their decision was caused by an inclination to avoid punishment or moral conscience;  \n\n* Video game industry assertion that pirate downloaders and 'ordinary' consumers are separate groups is unfounded. Regression analysis indicated that downloaders of pirate games are no less likely to purchase genuine versions;\n\n* Video game piracy is not prevalent and does not have a negative impact on sales of genuine video games.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This study is intended to scope and evaluate current theory and practice concerning models for OAP and engage with intellectual, legal and economic perspectives on OAP. It is also aimed at mapping the field of academic publishing in the UK and abroad, drawing specifically upon the experiences of CREATe industry partners as well as other initiatives such as SSRN, open source software, and Creative Commons. As a final critical goal, this scoping study will identify any meaningful gaps in the relevant literature with a view to developing further research questions. The results of this scoping exercise will then be presented to relevant\nindustry and academic partners at a workshop intended to assist in further developing the critical research questions pertinent to OAP.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.create.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CREATe-Working-Paper-2014-01.pdf\n|Link=http://www.create.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CREATe-Working-Paper-2014-01.pdf\n|Reference=Willinsky (2006); Boulton et al.

Motivation will principally be reputation based.\n* Universities and government research bodies are increasingly moving to an Open Access Mandate for published research. This should eventually lead to an environment where the predominate model is Open Access. In order to make sure that similar problems of economic imbalance between authors and publishers arise in the future, policy makers should carefully assess the Green and Gold models to ensure continued academic freedom and equitable access\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

An empirical study of software piracy among tertiary institutions in Singapore. Information & Management, 43(5), 640-649.\n|Abstract=We used a survey technique at Singapore’s three universities to examine perceptions of software piracy and to attempt to discover its underlying factors. About 500 responses were gathered from students and staff. By means of cluster and factor analysis, we were able to identify three groups that had been influenced by attitudes towards software publishers, general acceptance, convenience, and ethics. A decision tree method linked each pirate profile to demographic and computer-related variables. It showed that, while age was negatively related to software piracy, computer experience or computer usage demonstrated an ambiguous relationship to software piracy. Moreover, older respondents who used university software mainly at their workplace tended to pirate less frequently, while students tended to be pirates more often than university employees. Also Malays were the least frequent pirates in all the Singapore ethnic groups.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720606000450\n|Link=http://beta.orionsshoulders.com/Resources/articles/26_22232_%20().pdf\n|Reference=Business Software Alliance & International Data Corporation (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Cluster analysis defines three groups of software pirates within Singapore’s universities, each group having a very different profile: Frequent pirates, Infrequent pirates and Occasional pirates.\nEach group is defined by significant differences in their attitudes towards a range of factors related to software piracy: attitudes towards software publishers, acceptance of piracy, convenience, ethics and property rights protection\n\nThese demographic and computer-related variables have significant relationships with software piracy:\n\n# Age is the most important demographic variable across the three groups. Younger respondents (≤ age 35) are more likely to pirate software\n# Older respondents (> age 35) who use university software mainly at their workplace tend to pirate less frequently\n# Medium-age (age 26 – 35) students tend to pirate software more often than medium-age university employees\n# Among young respondents (< age 25) there is no identifiable relationship between software piracy and their extent of (a) computer experience or (b) computer usage\n# Malays are the least frequent pirates in all the Singapore ethnic groups\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

T. (2012). Trademark and copyright enforcement in the shadow of IP law. Santa Clara Computer and High Technology Law Journal, 28.\n|Abstract=In recent years, as Congress has created new intellectual property (IP) rights and courts have often interpreted those rights broadly, legal scholars have frequently decried the expanded scope of protection afforded IP owners in most substantive areas of IP law. According to this critique, the over-expansion of IP rights throughout the past two decades harms competition, chills free speech, and diminishes the public domain as increasingly broad areas of social life are brought within the scope of strong IP protection. While this over-expansion theory reflects an important - indeed, foundational - policy debate concerning the proper balance between IP owners\' rights and the public\'s rights of access to the information, ideas, and expressions\nthat IP protects, it is incomplete because it focuses largely on what Congress or the courts do. In reality, most enforcement of IP rights takes place not in court, but in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. "Cease and desist" letters, phone calls, and negotiations with alleged infringers constitute the bulk of IP enforcement efforts in trademark and copyright practice. To be sure, these efforts take place in the "shadow" of IP law and are therefore influenced by it. But it is in these everyday practices - and not in trial or appellate courts - that most IP rights are asserted, resisted, and negotiated. Thus, if we want to know whether IP rights are over-enforced or over-extended, we need to know how, why, and to what effect these\nrights are exercised in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. To date, however, IP scholarship has focused virtually no attention on this critical arena of everyday practice. This Article presents findings from a qualitative empirical study of the trademark and copyright disputing process outside of court, based on original data derived from semi-structured interviews with experienced\nIP attorneys who advise clients on how to enforce their rights. This research is one of the first studies to examine how trademark and copyright claims are actually enforced in practice. One significant finding from this study is that "repeat player" trademark and copyright owners (and their lawyers) knowingly assert weak IP claims at times - precisely because it works, as enforcement targets are unable or unwilling to resist claims that may lack legal merit due to the costs and uncertainties of threatened litigation. Moreover, the lawyers who assert weak IP claims have ready practical and ethical justifications for their actions. This study also suggests that legal sanctions directed at deterring over-reaching IP enforcement are unlikely to be effective because most such over-reaching occurs in informal disputing processes outside of the legal system.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/uk/legal/search/homesubmitForm.do\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990588\n|Reference=Gibson (2007); Nathenson (2010); Gallagher (2011); Boyle (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results: \n\n*Trademark and copyright lawyers and their clients sometimes enforce admittedly weak IP claims precisely because it can be an effective strategy with few downsides. \n\n*Aggressive trademark and copyright enforcement efforts often work, as enforcement targets frequently choose to capitulate or settle rather than resist claims on the legal merits, likely due to the costs and uncertainties inherent in IP litigation. \n\n*The study supports the thesis that trademarks and copyrights can be and often are over-enforced in everyday legal practice. \n\n*The lawyers in this study had few ethical concerns about enforcing even weak trademark and copyright claims, as the uncertainties of law and an asserted ethical duty to zealously advocate client interests were readily invoked to justify aggressive policing of IP rights. \n\n*The study delineates some of the perceived advantages that “repeat player” IP owners may enjoy when enforcing their IP rights, and it also demonstrates some of the factors that limit the ability and willingness of IP owners to enforce their rights. \n\n*Trademark and copyright owners may be able to “bully” enforcement targets, but only when they do not fear the backlash of negative publicity and public opinion that can accompany such efforts.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

A total of 58 interviews were completed. All but five of these interviews took place in person. The remaining five interviews were conducted by telephone.

To fill this gap, we conducted a study from the perspective of music consumers in which we grounded a theory that would explain and predict individual arguments and behavior. Our findings suggest that the morality of accessing culture depends on the social, economic and cultural context in which an individual has been raised. Interestingly, this contextual aspect interacts with economic and cultural resources, affecting the moral arguments used to justify behavior. Lastly, we describe a model that explains variations in the contextual theory in regard to accessing music and that predicts consumer behavior in other countries that can be classified in either of the two contexts delineated in our research.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10253860903063253\n|Reference=Glaser and Strauss (1967); Swinyard, Rinne and Kau (1990); Bishop (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article uses grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 1967) to conceptualize and model the complex social process for accessing and consuming music:\n\n*Its findings suggest that the morality of people’s actions regarding access to culture depends on the social, economic and cultural context in which they operate.

The sample consisted of 233 individuals from IT/technical occupations and 223 individuals from non-technical occupations drawn from a database of consumers of technology-oriented products and services from a large tele-communications organization. Data were collected using a 21 item questionnaire (measuring past behavior, moral disengagement, self-efficacy, outcome expectations and software piracy intention) deployed on an online survey tool. Data were analyzed with SAS using independent sample t-tests, Fisher’s Z transformations and multiple-group path analysis to test for occupational field of expertise as a moderator in the proposed structural model of social cognitive theory. Significant differences were found between the groups on the self-efficacy and intention to pirate software variables, with individuals from the IT/technical occupations group reporting higher scores. A significant difference was found in the association between outcome expectations and intention to pirate software with a higher correlation obtained for individuals from IT/technical occupations. Occupational field of expertise did not act as a moderator in the model. Thus, while there were some differences between individuals from IT/technical occupations and those from non-technical occupations in terms of individual social cognitive constructs and the associations between them, the social cognitive model for explaining software piracy intention was equally predictive for both groups. Implications of these findings will be explored.\n|Authentic Link=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/ehost/results?sid=522e432c-1f3a-4531-985d-7a986df775c8%40sessionmgr111&vid=4&hid=101&bquery=JN+%22International+Journal+of+Psychology%22+AND+DT+20120602&bdata=JmRiPXBiaCZ0eXBlPTEmc2l0ZT1laG9zdC1saXZl\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/260171160_The_impact_of_occupational_field_of_expertise_on_intention_to_pirate_software\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2473, 'title': 'Gasser', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

R. (2011). Copyright publication: an empirical study. Notre Dame Law Review, 87(1).\n|Abstract=The Article presents the first empirical study of copyright publication, a concept that can mark a critical moment in the life of a creative work. Books, magazines, films, software and plays, as well as works of art, architecture, music, and even choreography may be protected by copyright. For works created before 1976, knowing whether a work is published is often necessary for determining whether it is in the public domain so that anyone can use it, copy it or adapt it in other media without risking copyright liability. A court’s determination of whether a work is published also may be dispositive of issues such as the duration of the copyright, if others can make fair use of it and whether, in litigation, statutory damages and attorney’s fees are available. Despite the obvious import of this concept, it remains one of the most ambiguous features of copyright law. How do judges decide whether a creative work is published? This article presents the first comprehensive and systematic answer to that question. Based on a dataset of federal judicial opinions, this article analyzes the extent to which accepted notions of copyright publication conform with legal doctrine. The results reveal that often they do not. In particular, this article demonstrates that publication has a surprisingly inconsistent meaning across copyright issues, differing dramatically between the public domain and fair use contexts. The analysis shows that the characteristics of the work, as well as how it is distributed and accessed are important to courts when deciding whether a work is in the public domain. These findings are especially noteworthy, since contrary to popular belief, courts increasingly encounter the issue of publication when answering a wide variety of copyright questions. Drawing upon the empirical findings, the Article recommends that the commonly used definitions of publication be changed to reflect the factors upon which judges actually rely in deciding these cases.\n|Authentic Link=http://www3.nd.edu/~ndlrev/archive_public/87ndlr1/Gerhardt.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2016033\n|Reference=Nimmer and Nimmer (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Publication is still of great importance in judicial outcomes of copyright cases.

Therefore, the current statutory definition of publication is insufficient and does not reflect the practical application and consideration of publication.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

R. (2014). Copyright at the Museum: Using the Publication Doctrine to Free Art and History. Available at SSRN 2505041.\n|Abstract=This Article is the first to use the copyright publication doctrine to clarify whether art, photographs, films, and historical documents that fill our museums and libraries are in the public domain. Knowing whether a photo, painting, film, or original letter was published is critically important to anyone who wants to use it today. Before 1989, publishing a work with no copyright notice dedicated the work to the public domain. Unpublished works without a notice are likely protected by copyright, and their unauthorized use can result in severe federal penalties. Unfortunately, the meaning of “publication” in copyright law is notoriously ambiguous. The federal statutory definition suggests that works “made available” to the public are published, while leading treatises generally assume that works given to public museums and libraries are unpublished. Confronted with this uncertainty, risk averse institutions too often assume that archived works are protected by copyright. Misunderstanding the law can keep cultural treasures locked in dark archives, vaults and basements, preventing their use as a foundation for new expression and distorting our sense of history.\n\nThis Article critically examines mistaken assumptions about copyright publication. It finds that neither the statutory definition nor leading treatises adequately identify when a work is published. A better standard for determining when a work is published and in the public domain is needed to free works from being locked up by copyright uncertainty. The best solution would clarify the boundaries of a stable public domain. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court took a wrong turn in dismissing the importance of the public domain. Knowing what content may be freely used is critical to preserving First Amendment values and freeing cultural treasures from copyright’s bondage. The copyright ambiguity of archived works should be resolved in a way that honors the expressive and historical value of the public domain. After considering several alternatives, this Article shows how precedential patterns point to the best solution to the publication ambiguity. Drawing on empirical analysis of federal cases interpreting copyright publication, I identify the variables that are most important in determining whether archived works are published. The suggested solution focuses on copyright owner intent and the availability of authorized copies. Other factors described as significant in leading treatises — such as the type of work or archive — actually mask these two fundamental inquiries. The proposed standard provides a much needed solution to clarify which pieces of our cultural heritage are in the public domain and freely available as raw materials for educational sharing, expressive work, historical research, and public discourse.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2505041\n|Reference=Zimmerman (2007); Beebe (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In the six categories of text, 2D art, 3D art, music, film and all, district courts found works to be published 71% of the time.\n* With visual art, courts often found publication. In eight of the ten categories (photograph, painting, drawing, print, audiovisual work, sculpture fine art, sculpture, fabric design, architectural work, and map), publication findings exceeded the 71% average. Six categories (photographs, drawings, prints, sculpture, fabric design, and maps) exceed the average by more than 10 percentage points. The two lowest categories (audiovisual works at 45% and architectural works at 46%) were found to be published much less frequently.\n* The presence of authorized copies is the one variable that significantly increases (by 28%) the probability of finding publication. \n* With publication by deposit in archives, 64% of courts found works to be unpublished. \n* Although the copyright statute defines publication to include “rental, lease or lending,” the regression analysis revealed that courts were less likely to find a work published when they reported these distributions.

Access to content by new media platforms: a review of the competition law problems. European Law Review, February (2005).\n|Abstract=The paper seeks to provide a discussion of the competition law issues raised by access to premium content (essentially blockbusters and football rights) by content delivery operators with a special emphasis on new media platforms. A significant amount of literature has been published on the application of competition rules to premium content rights agreements, but the specific obstacles encountered by new media platforms have been relatively unexplored. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature. \n\nThe European Commission (hereafter, the Commission) has recognised in its decisions that premium content is an "essential input" for operators active in the delivery of audio-visual content. There is indeed no substitution possible with other less attractive forms of content. In fact, premium content such as major football events represents "stand-alone" driver content for pay-TV operators. Absent access to such content it is very difficult for a content delivery operator to gain or retain market shares. Access to premium content is thus a matter of life or death for such operators. \n\nYet, getting access to premium content is not an easy matter. First, premium content is scarce as there are only a few blockbusters and a limited number of premium sport events every year. Moreover, premium content rights contracts usually involve some form of exclusivity pursuant to which dominant pay-TV operators often manage to monopolize such rights for several years at the expense of weaker competitors. The combination of scarcity and exclusivity has translated into a spiralling of the costs involved in buying premium content. For instance, while in 1992, broadcasters paid 434 million euros for the TV rights of the English Premier League, in 2000, they paid 2,6 billion euros for only three seasons. \n\nThe lack of access to premium content represents a significant handicap for new entrants, such as new media platforms. If these platforms want to gain market share, they need to show programmes, which are able to compete with the content shown by dominant pay-TV operators. Access foreclosure to premium content would thus not only prevent new entries from taking place in the highly concentrated pay-TV market, but would also affect technological developments and consumer choice as the latter would be prevented from watching their favourite programmes on the platform of their choice. Thus, in a number of policy speeches, Commission officials have insisted on the importance that new media platforms gain access to premium content. \n\nThe main argument followed throughout the paper is that, while recent Commission decisions contain remedies, which will help new media platforms to gain access to premium content, such remedies are insufficient to create a level playing field in the market for the acquisition of such content. Numerous anti-competitive practices continue to plague this market and further competition law intervention is thus required.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=617265\n|Reference=McAuley (2004); Szymanski and Harbord (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Access to premium content is of critical importance for new media platforms as such content is necessary to attract viewers and gain market shares. \n* So far, it has been difficult for these platforms to gain access to premium movies, sports, or even TV channels.\n* Access foreclosure to premium content not only prevents new entry from taking place in the highly concentrated pay-TV market, but it also affects technological developments and consumer choice as the latter would be prevented from watching their favourite programmes on the platform of their choice.\n* In order to create a level playing field, an investigation should take place and recent CEC decisions limiting the exclusivity of premium content rights should augmented by other measures countering the anti-competitive practices of high minimum guarantees, holdback clauses, exploitation of rights through a system of windows, and Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clauses.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The index is used to examine what factors or characteristics of economies determine how strongly patent rights will be protected. The evidence does indicate that more developed economies tend to provide stronger protection. But the underlying factors which influence patent protection levels are the country's level of research and development (R&D) activity, market environment, and international integration, which are correlated with its level of development. The results qualify, however, that R&D activity influences patent .protection levels after a nation's research sector reaches a critical size. An implication of this is that to raise patent protection levels in weakly protecting countries, it is important to foster a significant research base in those countries and thereby create incentives\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873339700022X\n|Reference=Frame (1987); Rapp and Rozek (1990); Barro and Lee (1994); Summers et al. (1995); Johnson and Sheehy (1995).;\n|Plain Text Proposition=In order to facilitate comparisons of patent regimes across countries, this paper develops an index of patent rights (PR) for 110 countries for the period 1960-1990. After constructing the index, the paper analyzes country characteristics which predict how strongly a country will provide patent protection. The paper asks, for example, whether richer countries provide stronger protection, whether countries provide stronger protection as they develop, and whether such rights are better protected in democracies, freer markets, educated societies, in countries exposed to international trade, or in regions with higher levels of innovative activity. More specifically, this paper shows that:\n\n* Factors that reduce long run price or stimulate long run production should lead to a strengthening of patent protection.\n\n* The effects on patent protection are empirical questions. The 'expected' effects depend on the direct effects dominating, which may not be the case if a variable has a small direct effect or no effect at all on welfare.\n\n* The more developed economies provide stronger protection.\n\n* It is not the level of development per se that influences the provision of patent rights but rather the determinants of economic development, such as research and development, market freedom, and openness.\n\n* Political freedom and human capital have positive influences on patent rights but are not statistically significant at conventional levels.\n\n* R&D does not matter for the poorer economies\n\n* There is a critical size of a research sector, above which there is sufficient interest on the part of authorities to provide patent rights and below which there is not.\n\n* The market freedom variable consistently has the predicted effect on the patent rights of both rich and poor alike. It is market freedom, and not so much political freedom, that provides an environment conducive to innovation and production.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Thus, if the size of a research sector is small, inventors may not produce enough innovations to make the adoption of a patent system worthwhile. \n\n- Hence, at an international level, cooperative efforts should be directed at fostering a significant research base in countries where patent protection levels are low.\n\n- Countries that conduct significant innovative research are more likely to have vested interests in seeing patent rights respected. It is this fact that international negotiations should try to exploit.\n|Description of Data=The index was constructed for each of the 110 countries in the sample, quinquennially from 1960 to 1990, using a coding scheme applied to national patent laws.

The Commission’s DSM strategy for Europe, announced on May 6, 2015, aims to provide better access to tangible and digital goods and services, to create the right environment for the development and commercial success of digital innovation, and to maximise the growth of the digital economy across the EU28. As support and evidence base, two surveys of online consumers were carried out, looking particularly into their purchase activity for 12 types of tangible goods and offline services (e.g. clothes, travel services), usage of 4 types of online services (e.g. communication services) and access to 8 types of digital content (e.g. e-books). These included a core survey (covering online consumers from all EU28, Norway and Iceland) and a clickstream survey (targeted to online respondents from Belgium and Poland only who had expressed the intention to make at least one immediate online purchase).

The combined share of cross-border purchasing was one fifth (20%) of the total market value for tangible goods/offline services and digital content markets (14% inside the EU). \n\n* A much higher market penetration was observed for tangible goods and offline services when compared to online services and digital content. The proportion of EU28 online respondents who purchased tangible goods and offline services online at least once in the last 12 months was as high as 95%, whereas the corresponding proportions of respondents purchasing online services and digital content online were significantly smaller (20% and 44% respectively). This reflects the fact that a considerable proportion of online services and digital content is currently being provided for free. Nonetheless, survey results indicate that online services and digital content are used or accessed (instead of purchased) online at least once in the last 12 months at percentages comparable to the online purchases of tangible goods (93% for online services and 94% for digital content).\n\n* Data protection, payment security and consumer rights are key concerns in domestic ecommerce. \n\n* The average time online shoppers spent in total on their most recent online purchase was 3.1 hours. The three most preferred means of researching an online purchase were visiting online market places (42%), visiting seller or service provider websites (41%) and searching via a general search engine (38%).\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

To measure variation creative output, we use new data on 2,598 operas that premiered across eight states within Italy between 1770 and 1900. These data indicate that the adoption of copyrights led to a significant increase in the number of new operas premiered per state and year. We find that the number of high-quality operas also increased – measured both by their contemporary popularity and by the longevity of operas. By comparison, evidence for a significant effect of copyright extensions is limited. Our analysis of alternative mechanisms for this increase reveals a substantial shift in composer migration in response to copyrights. Consistent with agglomeration externalities, we also find that cities with a better pre-existing infrastructure of performance spaces benefitted more copyright laws.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2505776\n|Reference=Scherer, 2004; Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf, 2007; Waldfogel, 2011; Li et al., 2014; MacGarvie and Moser, 2014;\n|Plain Text Proposition=The paper uses data collected specifically by the authors to test the hypothesis that creativity (in terms of quantity and quality as in durability of the works) is increased by copyright. The test analyses differences in these data by Italian state starting from 1801, contrasting effects of two states where there was copyright from that date with output in other states that did not until much later. The findings are that the presence of copyright increase output and stimulated composer migration. The study does not find any effect for extensions of copyright.\n* Summary statistics on the changes in the number of new operas produced per state and year show that opera production increased significantly after Lombardy and Venetia adopted copyrights (from 1.55 new operas per state and year to 4.48 – a 189% increase). By comparison, in states that did not offer copyrights, production increased only 54% (from 1.36 to 2.10).\n* The creation of copyright may also have influenced by increasing the quality of new operas if composers had an intrinsic preference for producing high quality works, and if the additional revenue from copyrights relaxed their budget constraint enough to allow them to substitute quality for quantity. \n* Summary statistics indicate that composers in copyright state began to produce significantly more high-quality operas after its introduction in 1801 (composers premiers increased from 0.125 per year to 0.619 – a 396% increase). By comparison, in states that did not offer copyrights, production increased only 100% (from 0.083 to 0.167).\n* Summary statistics also indicate that composers in state-time pairs with copyright produced more historically popular operas than composers in states without copyrights.\n\nEditorial comment: A fundamental flaw in the paper is that it does not consider any economic effects that might also be associated with these results, specifically the influence of differential wealth. Lombardy and the Veneto were the most prosperous parts of Italy and that should be taken into consideration both for the remuneration composers would receive, the number of opera houses providing opportunities and the fact that composers follow the money as other studies have shown.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

While digital technology has improved the quality of audio and video recordings and decreased distribution costs, it has also made unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material and its transmission over the Internet easier. The media industry attributes an erosion of its sales after 1999 to the illegal copying and sharing of digital files and has taken steps to tighten copyright laws and prosecute violators. Others attribute the downturn to a lack of innovative products and futile efforts by the industry to retain a business model made obsolete by technological innovation. In the meantime, unauthorized file-sharing via Peer-to-Peer networks continues unabated and its real financial impact on the industry remains unclear. The market perceives illegal file-sharing to be a significant threat to the long-term profitability of the media industry and regards current legal initiatives to protect its intellectual capital as beneficial.

Software pirates may influence potential software users to adopt the software, and some of these adopters may become buyers. A diffusion modelling approach is suggested to track shadow diffusion and the legal diffusion of a software over time. The approach enables management to estimate (1) the pirated options over time and(2) the percentage of legal adoptions due to the influence of pirates. The modelling approach is applied to study the diffusion of two types of software (spreadsheets and word processors) in the United Kingdom.

Journal of Business Ethics, 77(4), 481-499.\n|Abstract=Softlifting, or the illegal duplication of copyrighted software by individuals for personal use, is a serious and costly problem for software developers and distributors. Understanding the factors that determine attitude toward softlifting is important in order to ascertain what motivates individuals to engage in the behavior. We examine a number of factors, including personal moral obligation (PMO), perceived usefulness, and awareness of the laws and regulations governing software acquisition and use, along with facets of personal self-identity that may play a role in the development of attitudes and therefore intentions regarding this behavior. These factors are examined across multiple settings expected to be pertinent to our survey respondents: home, work and school. Personal moral obligation and perceived usefulness are significant predictors of attitude across all settings. Past behavior is a significant predictor of intention across all settings, and a significant predictor of attitude in the home setting. We find evidence that awareness of the law causes a less favorable evaluation of softlifting in the school setting only, but has little effect in the home and work settings. As in previous studies, attitude is a significant predictor of intent. We do not find indications that one's personal self-identity influences one's attitude towards the behavior and the intention to perform it, except in the case of legal identity, where marginally significant effects are found in the work environment.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/article/10.1007/s10551-007-9361-0\n|Reference=Taylor and Shim (1993); Givon, Mahajan and Muller (1995); Glass and Wood (1996); Thong and Yap (1998); Banerjee, Cronan and Jones (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study:\n\n*Perceived usefulness is shown to positively influence an individual's attitude toward softlifting. \n\n*Additionally, one's moral obligation to avoid softlifting is significantly and negatively related to attitude toward this behavior. Prior research suggests that the moral component is an integral part of attitude and the empirical data strongly support this claim.\n\n*Risk-taking personal identity is positively related to one's attitude toward softlifting. However, this relationship is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the school setting. \n\n*Gender was not a significant factor in any setting. Previous research finds that males had a more favorable attitude towards software piracy than females, and suggests that one possible explanation might be that males were greater risk-takers. This study finds evidence to support the explanation offered by those prior studies.\n\n*Legal personal identity is negatively related to one's attitude toward softlifting but this relation is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the work setting. The ability to detect this effect may be limited by the single-item measure used in this study. Nonetheless, the results support the expectation of a negative effect of legal personal identity on attitude; this seems a promising avenue for further research.\n\n*Awareness of the law is significant in reducing a favorable attitude toward softlifting, but only at school, where a student runs a greater risk of loss of privileges or a blemish on his or her record.\n\n*The research model is able to explain over 60% of the variance in attitude toward softlifting in all settings. Prior studies involving the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model have shown that attitude is an important determinant of behavioral intention. \n\n*It is therefore important to understand the determinants of attitude in order to comprehend the reasons that such behavior exists. This model demonstrates that with a behavior that has a moral component (such as softlifting), personal moral attitude and legal personal identity are important in explaining attitude toward the behav- ior. \n\n*Additionally, perceived usefulness is significant as well. This model could possibly be useful in predicting other behaviors that include a strong moral component.\n\n*In addition to significant findings regarding the determinants of attitude toward softlifting, this research shows that when examining software piracy behavior, setting matters. Future research along these lines could produce intriguing results.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The age of the participants ranged from 17 to 51, with a median age of 23. Fifty-two percent of the participants were female. Respondents included those with very little computer experience (less than one year) and those with more extensive usage experience (up to 26 years). The average participant had 5–7 years of experience with computers. Approximately 63% of the respondents live in households with annual income of at least $25,000.

JRC/IPTS Digital Economy working paper 2015-04.\n|Abstract=The EU seeks to create a seamless online Digital Single Market for media products such as digital music and film. The territoriality of the copyright regime is often perceived as an obstacle that induces geographical segmentation. This paper provides empirical evidence on the extent of market segmentation in the EU on the supply and demand side and measures the contribution of several drivers of this market segmentation. We use data from the Apple iTunes country stores in 27 EU Member States to measure geographical market segmentation in supply (availability), demand (sales) and prices across the EU for downloadable digital music and film. We find that availability of EU media products across country stores in the EU is hovering around 80% for music and 40% for films. Recent industry initiatives to reduce the transaction costs of making digital music available across borders have resulted in a reasonably wide availability though still short of the 100% mark. Consumer preference variables such as cultural proximity, a shared language or border and inherent preferences for home market products are the main drivers for the observed geographical market segmentation in demand patterns, both for music and film.

We focus on creation of long-lived artistic original assets protected by copyright, as defined by the SNA. This includes new broadcast programmes, books, art, music and films. Investment is part of final Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and copyright works are assets that contribute to economic growth, so we have developed the framework to account for copyright investment, as reported by Goodridge and Haskel in July 2011.\n\nThis update to the work suggests that UK investment in copyright was approximately £5.1bn in 2009, or £3.2bn higher (0.3% of Gross Value Added (GVA) higher4) than existing official data recorded in the UK National Accounts, for the comparable series on pure copyright investment.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312765/ipresearch-ukinvestment-201206.pdf\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312765/ipresearch-ukinvestment-201206.pdf\n|Reference=Chamberlin, Clayton and Farooqui (2007); Goodridge and Haskel (2011); Kretschmer, Bently, Singh and Cooper (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=UK investment in copyright was approximately £5.1bn in 2009, or £3.2bn higher (0.3% of Gross Value Added (GVA) higher than existing official data recorded in the UK National Accounts, for the comparable series on pure copyright investment.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Do Artists Benefit from Online Music Sharing?*. The Journal of Business, 79(3), 1503-1533.\n|Abstract=We present a model of online music sharing that incorporates economic and technological incentives to sample, purchase, and pirate. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that lowering the cost of sampling music will propel more consumers to purchase music online as the total cost of evaluation and acquisition decreases. Attempts to prevent sampling will be counterproductive in the long run. Sharing technologies erode the superstar phenomenon widely prevalent in the music business. Extensive empirical investigations, based on surveys and Billboard ranking charts, lend support to the economic model and validate the key results.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/500683\n|Link=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjnlbus/v_3a79_3ay_3a2006_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1503-1534.htm\n|Reference=Matthews (2000); Gopal and Sanders (2000); Gopal, Sanders, Bhattacharjee, Agrawal and Wagner (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n*Decreasing sampling costs not only lead more potential consumers to sample unknown music items but also lead more consumers to buy the music items that they have sampled.\n\n* Lower sampling costs have a positive effect on the consumer surplus of samplers, which, in turn, has a positive effect on their purchasing intentions.\n\n* The industry can potentially reverse the effects of online audio piracy by providing more legal and efficient sampling techniques that consumers could use. This is contrary to the anecdotal belief that online availability of digital music leads only to a drain on profitability.\n\n* The impact of music availability online has a differential impact based on the realized value of the music to the consumers. For higher valued songs, online search and sampling capabilities have a beneficial impact on sales. Lower valued music items are pirated more than higher valued items, ceteris paribus, and consequently sales of those suffer. \n\n* Superstars come under increasing threat from two fronts: (a) a greater proportion of sampling of superstar music leads to piracy—users who sample do so with an increased intention to pirate, and (b) decreasing sampling costs lead to an erosion of superstardom. However, there is a greater probability of discovering other high quality music items by lesser known artists with the new technology, which will hurt a superstar’s sales—and, hence, status.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Econometrica, 72(2), 351-381.\n|Abstract=This paper examines direct broadcast satellites (DBS) as a competitor to cable. We first estimate a structural consumer level demand system for satellite, basic cable, premium cable and local antenna using micro data on almost 30000 households in 317 markets, including extensive controls for unobserved product quality and allowing the distribution of unobserved tastes to follow a fully flexible multivariate normal distribution. The estimated elasticity of expanded basic is about -15, with the demand for premium cable and DBS more elastic. The results identify strong correlations in the taste for different products not captured in conventional logit models. Estimates of the supply response of cable suggest that without DBS entry cable prices would be about 15 percent higher and cable quality would fall. We find a welfare gain of between $127 and $190 per year (aggregate $2.5 billion) for satellite buyers, and about $50 (aggregate $3 billion) for cable subscribers.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00494.x/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+17+Dec+from+10-13+GMT+for+IT+maintenance.\n|Link=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/austan.goolsbee/research/satfin.pdf\n|Reference=Petrin (2002); Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1998); Berry (1994); Goolsbee (2000); Hausman (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The results indicate that the own-price elasticity of expanded basic is at about -1.5 while the demands for premium cable and DBS are substantially more elastic (-3.2 and -2.4). The cross-price elasticities suggest that DBS and premium are the closest substitutes. \n\n* The supply side results exploit the estimated controls from the structural demand side model and suggest that more competition from DBS is correlated with lower cable prices and somewhat higher quality cable. \n\n* Overall there is a significant welfare gain to the 16 million satellite buyers between $2-3 billion, depending upon whether changes in cable prices and characteristics are added back into the calculation. The aggregate gains to the 70 million cable users amount to between roughly $3-4 billion.\n\n* The findings suggest large gains from DBS entry, some of which are not captured if the price and characteristics' response is ignored. The overall gains from this product introduction may be as large as $7 billion, illustrating once again the importance of understanding the impact of new goods on consumer welfare.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Columbia Law Review, 82(8), 1600-1657.\n|Abstract=An economic and structural analysis of the fair use doctrine and its place in the copyright scheme reveals that fair use is ordinarily granted when the market cannot be relied upon to allow socially desirable access to, and use of, copyrighted works. This article presents a three-part test for fair use that reflects this focus on market failure, and traces how this test could be incorporated within the traditional approach to fair use. Moreover, the discussion of the Williams & Wilkins opinion, which most closely applies the three-part test, and of the Betamax case, demonstrated that the test can provide a framework in which the courts can directly face the underlying issues that should govern the application of fair use doctrine to new technologies.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.detritus.net/rhizome/legal/Gordon-Fair_Use.html\n|Link=http://www.detritus.net/rhizome/legal/Gordon-Fair_Use.html\n|Reference=Kaplan (1967); House report (1976); Posner (1977); Markovitz (1975); Calabresi and Melamed (1972);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Where (1) defendant could not appropriately purchase the desired use through the market; (2) transferring control over the use to defendant would serve the public interest; and (3) the copyright owner\'s incentives would not be substantially impaired by allowing the user to proceed, courts have in the past considered, and should in the future consider, defendant\'s use "fair." While other approaches to fair use may legitimately be advanced, much of fair use depends on the resolution of these concerns.\n\n* Contrary to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\'s view in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of America (Betamax) 659 F.2d 963 (9th Cir.1981), the "productive" status of a user is at best merely a secondary indicator that these concerns may be satisfied. \n\n* The courts and Congress have employed fair use to permit uncompensated transfers that are socially desirable but not capable of effectuation through the market.\n\n* It is important that a market failure approach to fair use not be expanded into a justification for allowing court intervention whenever the market fails to reach "perfect" results, for no market is ever perfect. What emerges from the case law and the copyright statute is a focus on individual types of transactions, not a concern with restructuring an entire set of markets to reach ideal goals, and an identification of those imperfections that will not be tolerated because of their particular impact on dissemination and the ultimate goals of copyright. That transactional emphasis is the proper one. It allows particularly desirable transfers that are blocked by market failure to go forward outside the market, but also allows the courts to impose liability where widespread use of this bypass would cause substantial injury to the copyright owner.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2006). Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. The Stationery Office.\n|Abstract=For many citizens, Intellectual Property (IP) is an obscure and distant domain – its laws shrouded in jargon and technical mystery, its applications relevant only to a specialist audience. And yet IP is everywhere. Even a simple coffee jar relies on a range of IP rights – from patents to copyright, designs to trade marks.\n\nIn the modern world, knowledge capital, more than physical capital, drives the UK economy. Against the backdrop of the increasing importance of ideas, IP rights, which protect their value, are more vital than ever. The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nThe Government’s decision to commission this Review was an explicit recognition both of the growing importance of IP and of the challenges brought by the changing economic environment. In commissioning the Review, the Chancellor and the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, and Culture, Media and Sport asked me to establish whether the system was fit for purpose in an era of globalisation, digitisation and increasing economic specialisation.\n\nThe answer is a qualified ‘yes’. I do not think the system is in need of radical overhaul. However, taking a holistic view of the system, I believe there is scope for reform to serve better the interests of consumers and industry alike. There are three areas in which the Review concentrates its recommendations to improve the UK framework for innovation:\n\n• strengthening enforcement of IP rights, whether through clamping down on piracy or trade in\ncounterfeit goods;\n• reducing costs of registering and litigating IP rights for businesses large and small; and\n• improving the balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use\ncontent in ways consistent with the digital age.\n\nMuch IP policy is framed by European, and indeed global, treaties and agreements. I recognise that not all the recommendations are within the direct purview of the UK Government. However, I have not shied away from making recommendations with European or broader international import when they seemed necessary. Indeed, with the European Commission currently reviewing both the copyright acquis and the question of a Community patent, this is a timely point at which to put forward the Review’s arguments. \n\nI would like to express my thanks to all those who assisted me in producing this Review. Many individuals and organisations gave generously of their time to contribute insights, and in particular the great diversity and depth of responses to the Call for Evidence were invaluable. I owe a special debt to the Review team, who have supported me throughout: Richard Sargeant, Steve Coles, Alastair Cowie, Suzy Kantor, Nicola Kay, Stephen Rowan and Nathan Sansom.\n\nI hope this Review provides sound recommendations on how the IP regime should respond to the challenges that it faces. Getting the balance right is vital to driving innovation, securing investment and stimulating competition. Lasting success will belong to those who get this right.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228849/0118404830.pdf\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228849/0118404830.pdf\n|Reference=Brooks (2005); Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law (2006); Boldrin & Levine (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition="The Review found the current system to be broadly performing satisfactorily. However, there are a number of areas where reform is necessary to improve the system for all its users. The Review therefore sets out a range of pragmatic recommendations, which can be grouped around three themes: first, stronger enforcement of rights; second, lower costs for business; and finally, balanced and flexible rights."\n\nFrom these conclusions the review makes a considerable number of policy recommendations which can be found below.\n|FundamentalIssue=1. Relationship between protection (subject matter/term/scope) and supply/economic development/growth/welfare, 4. Effects of protection on industry structure (e.g. oligopolies; competition; economics of superstars; business models; technology adoption), 3. Harmony of interest assumption between authors and publishers (creators and producers/investors),\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=A. Nature and Scope of exclusive rights (hyperlinking/browsing; reproduction right), B. Exceptions (distinguish innovation and public policy purposes; open-ended/closed list; commercial/non-commercial distinction), C. Mass digitisation/orphan works (non-use; extended collective licensing),\n|Discipline=A1: General Economics, O34: Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital\n|Intervention-Response=The review states the following about instruments of Intellectual Property (IP); patents, copyright, trade marks and designs.\n\n• balance; the instruments should ensure that the incentive to innovate is balanced against the ability of follow-on innovators to access knowledge.\n\n• coherence; the instruments should be clear and consistent; the scope of rights should not change retrospectively in order to ensure trust in the system; and the international system should promote innovation in all countries.\n\n• flexibility; the instruments should be flexible in order to respond to the changing economic environment and the needs of rights holders and users.\n\nThe Review has made a number of recommendations to improve the framework for innovation; in particular it has called for:\n\n• stronger enforcement of IP rights to ensure practical protection is provided for rights owners and effective deterrents to infringement are in place.\n\n• lower operational costs for business, simplifying processes such as licensing and litigation, and improving education and advice.\n\n• greater balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use information and ideas in ways consistent with the digital age.\n\nSpecific to copyright the review made the following key recommendations:\n\n* Enable educational provisions to cover distance learning and interactive whiteboards by 2008 by amending sections 35 and 36 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988 (CDPA).\n\n* The European Commission should retain the length of protection on sound recordings and performers’ rights at 50 years.\n\n*Policy makers should adopt the principle that the term and scope of protection for IP rights should not be altered retrospectively.\n\n* Introduce a limited private copying exception by 2008 for format shifting for works published after the date that the law comes into effect. There should be no accompanying levies for consumers.\n\n* Allow private copying for research to cover all forms of content. This relates to the copying, not the distribution, of media.\n\n* Amend s.42 of the CDPA by 2008 to permit libraries to copy the master copy of all classes of work in permanent collection for archival purposes and to allow further copies to be made from the archived copy to mitigate against subsequent wear and tear.\n\n* Enable libraries to format shift archival copies by 2008 to ensure records do not become obsolete.\n\n* Propose that Directive 2001/29/EC be amended to allow for an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the parameters of the Berne Three Step Test.\n\n* Create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008. \n\n* Propose a provision for orphan works to the European Commission, amending Directive 2001/29/EC.\n\n* The Patent Office should issue clear guidance on the parameters of a ‘reasonable search’ for orphan works, in consultation with rights holders, collecting societies, rights owners and archives, when an orphan works exception comes into being.\n\n* The Patent Office should establish a voluntary register of copyright; either on its own, or through partnerships with database holders, by 2008.\n\n* Match penalties for online and physical copyright infringement by amending section 107 of the CDPA by 2008.\n\n* Monitor success of current measures to combat unfair competition in cases relating to IP, and if changes are found to be ineffective, Government should consult on appropriate changes.\n\n* DCA should review the issues raised in its forthcoming consultation paper on damages and seek further evidence to ensure that an effective and dissuasive system of damages exists for civil IP cases and that it is operating effectively. It should bring forward any proposals for change by the end of 2007.\n\n* Observe the industry agreement of protocols for sharing data between ISPs and rights holders to remove and disbar users engaged in ‘piracy’. If this has not proved operationally successful by the end of 2007, Government should consider whether to legislate.\n\n* The Home Office should recognise IP crime as an area for Police action as a component of organised crime within the updated National Community Safety Plan.\n\n* Give Trading Standards the power to enforce copyright infringement by enacting section 107A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 by 2007.\n\n* Strengthen Practice Directions, to provide greater encouragement for parties to mediate, in particular this should raise the profile of mediation with judges.\n\n* The Patent Office should consult with the Judicial Studies Board to determine the extent to which the complexity of IP law may give rise to a training need for judges and magistrates and their legal advisers.\n\n* Support the establishment of a single EU court to adjudicate cross-border IP disputes by promoting the European Patent Litigation Agreement. \n\n* Establish a new Strategic Advisory Board for IP policy (SABIP), covering the full range of IP rights, reporting to the minister responsible, by 2007. The Board should be drawn from a wide range of external experts as well as key senior policy officials from relevant government departments, and should be based in London. £150,000 should be allocated to fund the secretariat by the Patent Office.\n\n* The Patent Office should provide an annual IP strategic analysis fund of £500,000 managed by the policy advisory board in consultation with the IP Policy Directorate.\n\n* Patent Office should introduce a clear split of responsibility between delivery and policy directorates.\n\n* Encourage IP policy officials to obtain policy experience outside the IP Policy Branch, and support short industry placement schemes for policy staff.\n\n*Realign UK Patent Office administrative fees to cover costs more closely on Patent Office administrative operations (e.g. granting patents).\n|Description of Data=The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property covers the 4 core elements of IP: Copyright, Designs, Patents and Trademarks.\n\nSpecific to copyright the review draws on a broad range of primary (research commissioned for the report and responses to calls for evidence) and secondary sources. \n\nThe primary source data includes research commissioned by Gowers including from the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law (CIPIL) at Cambridge University. This research has also been published independently of the review.  \n\nThe Review call for evidence elicited 517 responses and a petition on extending copyright term for sound recordings. These responses varied from submissions by individuals (including creators, representatives and academics) to those made by corporate stakeholders (collecting societies, public sector organisation and trade bodies among others).\n\nThe secondary source data is largely drawn from two distinct types of source: industry data (e.g. annual statements, industry generated research) and academic studies of relevant issues (e.g. Brooks 2005).\n|Data Year=Pre-2006\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Industry Data; Pre-existing Academic Research; Policy Reports;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Qualitative Collection Methods\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Qualitative Analysis Methods\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment; Film and motion pictures; Television programmes; Sound recording and music publishing; Programming and broadcasting; Computer programming; Specialised design; Photographic activities; Cultural education; Software publishing (including video games); Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Translation and interpretation;\n|Country=UK;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=HM Treasury;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=517\n|Level of Aggregation=Responses to Call for Evidence,\n|Data Material Year=2006\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2280, 'title': 'Gowers, A.', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2324, 'title': 'Graff Zivin, J.S.', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2616, 'title': 'Green, JR', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

An experimental investigation on the effect of charitable donations on piracy\n|Year=2008\n|Full Citation=Grolleau, G., Mzoughi, N., & Sutan, A. (2008). Please do not pirate it, you will rob the poor! An experimental investigation on the effect of charitable donations on piracy. The Journal of Socio-Economics, 37(6), 2417-2426.\n|Abstract=Producers in the recording industry frequently market products for which a part of the proceeds goes to charitable causes. We investigate whether a corporate pledge to donate a portion of profits to a charitable cause will decrease the extent to which customers illegally obtain that company\'s products. Donations to charitable causes may increase the moral intensity of piracy (robbing the poor rather than robbing the rich) and consequently may reduce the willingness to pirate. This rationale is empirically tested through a dual empirical strategy, that is, a market survey and a laboratory experiment. We show that market piracy decreases when a very low or very high donation mechanism is implemented. Nevertheless, for intermediate levels of transfer, piracy increases again.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1053535708000164\n|Link=http://prodinra.inra.fr/?locale=en#!ConsultNotice:23335\n|Reference=Cheng, Sims, Teegen (1997); Hui and Png (2003); Bishop (2004); Liebowitz (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study:\n\n*The hypothesis "Donation to social causes reduces piracy" is confirmed since the level of piracy is lower when a donation mechanism is present \n\n*Consequently, the number of real exchanges is higher in the experimental session in which a donation mechanism is implemented. When no donation mechanism is implemented, the number of exchanges is the lowest, the rate of piracy (measured by the non-respect of the official exchange rate) is the highest, the stated and effective exchange rate are the lowest, and, the level of ethical dissonance is the lowest.\n\n*In sum, donation does not reduce piracy for intermediate levels of transfer, which partly supports hypothesis "The higher the donation level, the lower the piracy rate."\n\n*This result is consistent with the market survey, in which some individuals argued that profit-oriented firms are unlikely to devote intermediate or high percentages of proceeds to charitable causes. The relationship between donations (as a percentage of proceeds) and the level of piracy seems to follow a roughly U-shaped curve. \n\n*This result can be intuitively interpreted in terms of piracy elasticity. Piracy elasticity for a given product measures the responsiveness of piracy of this product to a given change in the amount of donations, which can be expressed as the percentage of the proceeds devoted to a social cause.\n|FundamentalIssue=5. Understanding consumption/use (e.g. determinants of unlawful behaviour; user-generated content; social media),\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=F. Enforcement (quantifying infringement; criminal sanctions; intermediary liability; graduated response; litigation and court data; commercial/non-commercial distinction; education and awareness),\n|Discipline=D03: Behavioral Microeconomics • Underlying Principles, K42: Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law, M31: Marketing\n|Intervention-Response=Policy implications:\n\n*Donations to charitable causes can be “instrumentalized” by pirated firms or may simply constitute a byproduct of other motivations such as improving the company’s image or altruistic behavior. In the latter, the reduction in piracy can be considered as an unintended effect. \n\n*The percentage of proceeds devoted to the social cause and the characteristics of the social cause are likely to influence the extent to which pirates modify their behavior.\n\n*Without neglecting capitalistic (e.g., technological devices preventing fraudulent copies) and regulatory alternatives (e.g., monitoring investments, lobbying for severe sanctions against pirates), taking into account psychological and moral factors may lead managers to increase “moral barriers” for pirates and/or to align pirates’ moral incentives with the firm’s interests. The strategic use of charitable  causes to increase the moral intensity of piracy requires comprehensive knowledge of pirates and of their perceptions of different causes.\n|Description of Data=In April 2006, a market survey was conducted with a representative sample of 168 people in the metropolitan areaof Dijon, France. The sample is gender-balanced with 48% female and 52% male, with a mean age of 21 years. The survey was based on a 40-item questionnaire related to music piracy and individual characteristics. The survey was conducted on a face-to-face basis.\n\nThe experiment was a standard public good game. The experimental market was composed of two types of participants: consumers and record producers. The experiment was completely decontextualized: endowments, profits and donations were printed on different colored tickets, and no reference was made to CDs or donations. At the beginning of the experiment, all agents received an endowment in colored tickets.\nThese colored tickets were exchanged for money at the end of the experiment following a set of rules.\nEach consumer was given yellow tickets. Half of the “consumers” were given a large endowment and the other half a (very) low endowment. Each record producer was given red tickets. An official exchange rate (yellow tickets into red tickets) was given and all rules were made public to the participants. We focused on “consumer” behavior\nin this experimental market. The consumers had to exchange their yellow tickets for red tickets. Red tickets held by “consumers” at the end of each session were exchanged for real money at a 1-to-1 basis (1 red ticket = 1 euro). The record producers had to exchange their red tickets for yellow tickets. Each yellow ticket held by a “producer” at the end of a session was exchanged for .66 euro. The sessions were organized as follows: 21 participants were involved in a session. The experiment took place in two different rooms (A and B). The participants were split into two groups, 20 consumers were in room A and one producer was in room B. \nThree sessions (one per treatment) were conducted with 63 participants in April 2006 in the Business School of Burgundy in Dijon. Participants were students in various fields and at various levels in schools and universities of Dijon. They received a show-up fee of 5 euro (s= 5) and the money earned during the experiment. The experiment lasted 45 min and participants earned between 5 euro and 25 euro.\n|Data Year=April 2006\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Experimental (Laboratory), Qualitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association, Multivariate Statistics, Regression Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=France;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=Not stated;\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1483, 'title': 'Greenhalgh, Phillips, Pitkethly, Rogers and Tomalin (2010)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Greenhalgh, Phillips, Pitkethly, Rogers and Tomalin (2010)\n|Author=Greenhalgh, C.; Phillips, J.; Pitkethly, R.; Rogers, M.; Tomalin, J.\n|Title=Intellectual Property Enforcement in Smaller UK Firms\n|Year=2010\n|Full Citation=Greenhalgh, C., Philips, J., Pitkethly, R., Rogers, M., & Tomalin, J.

It considers the attitudes and practices of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro firms as well as the cost implications of the present IP enforcement system in the UK.\n\nAccording to an earlier report for SABIP, by Weatherall et al. 2009, in the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property questions of enforcement were largely addressed through assertion, rather than empirical research. This report aims to provide such research. Our study included both an online survey and a phone survey. These concentrated on SMEs and micro firms rather than being a comparative study with large firms. Further work obtained information on Patents and Registered Design cases listed for hearings in the Patents Court from 2003 to 2009. The analysis of this data provides some evidence that complements the results of the survey.\n|Authentic Link=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140603093549/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-ipenforcement-201010.pdf\n|Link=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140603093549/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-ipenforcement-201010.pdf\n|Reference=Gowers (2006); Weatherall, Webster and Bently (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study covers all aspects of IP.

Journal of Business Ethics, 55(3), 255-274.\n|Abstract=Consumers of software often face an acquisition-mode decision, namely whether to purchase or pirate that software. In terms of consumer welfare, consumers who pirate software may stand in opposition to those who purchase it. Marketers also face a decision whether to attempt to thwart that piracy or to ignore, if not encourage it as an aid to their software\'s diffusion, and policymakers face the decision whether to adopt interventionist policies, which are government-centric, or laissez faire policies, which are marketer-centric. Here in order to assess the decision-making of all three of these stakeholders, we focus on the consumer\'s point-of-view as central and examine it by considering on a comparative basis the ethical dimension versus other dimensions, including economic,legal, and other salient consumer behavior considerations. Based on a survey of 689 software consumers conducted over the Internet, the results indicate that ethics as a factor is embedded in a multidimensional set of determinant factors influencing software piracy, including attitudes, legal aspects, social support,perceptions of economic loss and age. Policy and research implications, based on these findings, are provided.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25123390?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n|Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-004-0991-1\n|Reference=Cheng et al.

Consumers who are less concerned with ethics are more likely to pirate than others. \n\n*Ethics and legal aspects may be conflated or combined by consumers as indicated in the ATTITUDE variable. \n\n*Another important finding concerns social support for piracy (SOCIAL). In this regard, softiifting is not a mere individual action, but takes place in a technologically oriented community ecosystem in which piracy for many is a tolerated, if not an ethically or socially prescribed, consumer and business tool.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Ultimately, controls should be applied which provide for maximal purchase of software while affording consumers the appropriate amount of product trial, reduction of risk, and comfort with the product.\n|Description of Data=The data were collected through a survey posted on the World Wide Web (WWW) that could be accessed by all standard web browsers (Netscape,Internet Explorer, etc.).

Its purpose is to consider how Member States have implemented the Directive into national law and to assist the Commission in evaluating whether the Directive, as currently formulated, remains the appropriate response to the continuing challenges faced by the stakeholders concerned, such as rights holders, commercial users, consumers, educational and scientific users. As set out in specifications of the study set out by the Commission, its aim is 'to assess the role that the Directive has played in fostering the digital market for goods and services in the four years since its adoption'. The impact of the Directive on the development of digital (chiefly online) business models, therefore, will be the focal point of our enquiry throughout this study.\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/infosoc-study_en.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2006358\n|Reference=Bechtold (2006); Gowers (2006); Ricketson (2006); Towse (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*The exclusive rights laid down in the Directive have indeed contributed to increased confidence in emerging digital markets and online business models. This conclusion however was to be mitigated by the fact that many of these rights already existed prior to the Directive, albeit not in a harmonized European framework. \n*The right of making available has undoubtedly resulted in a large-scale redrafting of contracts to adapt to online markets. However, applying the terms of the Directive does not always lead to clear-cut results. To cite one example, it remains unclear and entails practical problems whether streaming is to fall under the right of making available or if it is to be counted under broadcasting rights.\n*The codification of a broad right of reproduction that includes temporary copying is widely perceived as having created obstacles to budding online business models. This stems from the fact that it has created an overlap with the right of communication to the public, which adds complexity to the licensing process and sometimes a need for ‘double’ licenses from concurrent rightholders or collecting societies. Indeed, it could be said that this aspect of the Directive has raised transaction costs. It was therefore suggested to further restrict the right of reproduction to the realm of physical copies.\n*The need to simplify cross-border licensing which is still tributary to national laws was also broached. One way to deal with this was to promote Community-wide licensing, as was being attempted by the Commission’s Recommendation. Another, more fundamental approach would be to truly unify copyright norms by establishing a unified European copyright regime.\n*A clear need for a higher degree of harmonisation was certainly felt in the area of limitations. Most participants seemed to favour the introduction of a list of mandatory exceptions, possibly including certain non-overridable limitations. However, because many such exceptions are informed by cultural considerations, not everyone agreed such a mandatory list is desirable. Those who favoured a rapprochement with the American ‘fair use’ concept were countered with the argument that its flexibility could undermine legal certainty. It was agreed that consumer interests which are also reflected in certain exceptions to copyright should be dealt with primarily in the framework of consumer law.\n*The application of TPMs, in turn, has likely fostered the emergence of online business models as investment in online subscription services has apparently increased. However, many doubt the necessity of adding an additional legal layer of protection through anti-circumvention rules.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

In this context, the need to protect consumers’ privacy was underscored. Finally, a dangerous tendency was observed to use TPMs to protect business models rather than content. It was agreed this perverted the purpose of the Directive which is to protect TPMs to benefit of rightholders. A standardisation of TPMs could help to avoid such abuses. Legal solutions to this problem, however, are best found in consumer law and competition law rather than copyright law.\n|Description of Data=This methodology has an empirical and an analytical component that might help predicting the Directive’s impact on the behaviour of market players. For the empirical part Berlecon Research has conducted a qualitative survey among stakeholders by means of interviews and a workshop organised in Berlin on the subject.

Piracy of the new millennium: An application of criminological theories to digital piracy. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences, 70, 3647.\n|Abstract=Over the course of the past decade, digital piracy has increasingly become an area of concern. Despite this rising interest in the crime, only a few empirical studies of digital piracy have been conducted from a criminological perspective. Though they form an important foundation for research in this area, there are weaknesses in the design of these previous studies. Specifically, prior studies have used convenience samples, been cross-sectional, used weak question wording or questionable scenarios, failed to distinguish between online and offline piracy, and used linear regression estimations. This study uses a random and longitudinal sample of college students to improve upon these areas in testing criminological influences on digital piracy. Results indicate that some criminological influences are predictive of digital piracy, though only whether someone pirated music, not the frequency of their involvement. Moreover, the impact and significance of these predictors at least partially fades when tested with longitudinal data.\n|Authentic Link=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/pqdt/docview/304870815/219FD1B3E9694CAFPQ/1?accountid=14540\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

(2009). Of ducks and downloads: The moral economy of intellectual property in post-Soviet society. Libri, 59(4), 248-258.\n|Abstract=As living standards have risen in recent years the citizens of post-Soviet states are turning increasingly toward newly available high bandwidth Internet connections as a new medium for the exchange of music, films, and computer software. Taking Ukraine as an example, the author argues that users are literally and metaphorically reconstructing imported Internet technologies in accordance with their own pre-existing cultures. The author probes these understandings through analysis of statements on file sharing behavior made by a sample of Ukrainian Internet users. To explain this distinctive technological path, the author examines the interaction of technologies, users, and regulatory regimes. These have shaped the understanding of ordinary users toward what the author, following E.P. Thompson, calls the “moral economy” of copyright and file sharing. The transition from this moral economy of intellectual property to the global intellectual property regime has occurred in law but not in practice.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/libr.2009.59.issue-4/libr.2009.022/libr.2009.022.xml\n|Link=http://www.tomandmaria.com/maria/publications/MoralEconomyPrinted%20Libri.pdf\n|Reference=Pinch and Bijker (1987); Thompson (1991); Haigh (2007); Hackett et al.

Users of computer networks struggle to assert traditional rights in a world remade by new technological and economic systems, yet the traditional understandings and norms on which Internet users draw vary in each country.\n\n- In Ukraine, assimilation into the emerging global intellectual property regime involves paradoxical developments. Proponents of membership in the World Trade Association argue that this is a crucial step in Ukraine’s transition from socialist serfdom to capitalist freedom.\n\n- Yet Ukrainians are aware that full entry into the global intellectual property regime means giving up other kinds of freedom, threatening deeply rooted practices of file sharing that they justify on moral grounds such as poverty, practical necessity, or religious obligation.\n\n- The freedom to copy unlicensed media files is assumed not just by young people but by Internet service providers and small businesses. The transition from the moral economy of intellectual property to the global intellectual property regime has occurred in law but not in practice.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

There is some confusion as to what is legal and illegal, although those admitting to illegal use spend more online on cultural assets than average.  Half of web users admit to illegal use (at least once), and 95% of those questioned think that French web users behave illegally (a significant gap between what is declared and what is projected). Illegal use is concentrated mainly among those aged 15-39 and men, and there is no difference between residents of the Paris Metropolitan Region and the Provinces. The practice is not slowing down and is becoming more diverse.\nIn terms of equipment, those declaring illegal use are better-equipped in general and particularly as regards external hard drives, smartphones and audio /video players. In terms of impact, almost half of web users declaring illegal use say that Hadopi will not change their behaviour, while a third would be willing to change and a fifth (17%) gave no response.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Profit leak? pre-release file sharing and the music industry supplementary appendix.\n|Abstract=It is intuitive that the potential for buyers to obtain a good without remuneration can harm the producer of the good. I test if this holds empirically in the music industry using data from an exclusive file-sharing website that allows users to share music files using the BitTorrent protocol. These are the most reliable file-sharing data available because they are from a private tracker, which is an invitation-only file-sharing network. \n\nTo overcome the endogeneity of the number of downloads, I exploit variation in the availability of sound recordings in file-sharing networks to isolate the causal effect of file-sharing on music sales. The results strongly suggest that the aggregate effect of file-sharing is precisely estimated to be extremely small. The direction of the effect is positive but its magnitude indicates that file-sharing does not increase or decrease aggregate sales in the music industry. I conclude with an investigation of the distributional effects of file-sharing on sales and find that file-sharing benefits more established and popular artists at the expense of newer and smaller artists. These results are consistent with recent trends in the music industry.\n|Link=https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IIOC2012&paper_id=216\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Zentner (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Liebowitz (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* File sharing does not increase or decrease sales in the music industry but that this aggregate impact masks important distributional effects. \n\n* The results suggest that established/popular artists benefit from file sharing, while new/small artists do not. In particular, file sharing redistributes sales toward artists in the pop genre and away from artists in niche genres such as indie music. \n\n* The effects of file sharing are meaningfully positive for artists who have had an album sell at least 100,000 units but not for artists who have not. Likewise, the effects are meaningfully positive for artists who have released more than three albums but not for newer artists.\n\n* These distributional effects are likely to have important consequences for the ability of the music industry to continue to produce sound recordings that cater to a large variety of tastes among heterogeneous music consumers.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

To understand how a shift toward more established artists will affect the trajectory of the music industry, one must conjecture how major and independent labels will respond to the increasingly top-heavy landscape that is predicted by these findings. It is arguable that one should expect increasing concentration of recording and distribution labels and it would be worthwhile to\ninvestigate how much of the increased concentration that has already occurred can be explained by file sharing.\n|Description of Data=The data is drawn from both primary and secondary sources. The primary source data is taken from a search of Bit Torrent Tracker for 5 weeks from May 25th 2010. \n\nThe tracker was searched for the following information relating to leaked albums: if the album had leaked, the day, hour, and minute that the album leaked; the number of cumulative downloads of the album; the number of current seeders; and the number of current leechers. On each successive Tuesday, the data collection process was repeated for the albums that were released that day and the number of cumulative downloads, current seeders, and current leechers for the albums that were released in the previous weeks.\n\nOf the 1,095 albums in the data set, 991 (90.5%) of the albums leaked and 655 (59.8%) of the albums leaked prior to their\nrelease date.\n\nThe secondary data was album sales data relating to leaked albums for the first 6 weeks after release.

Based on bibliometric data, we show that where DM for academic research requires the express consent of rights holders: (1) DM makes up a significantly lower share of total research output; and (2) stronger rule-of-law is associated with less DM research. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an empirical study bears out a significant negative association between copyright protection and innovation.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2608513\n|Reference=Dasgupta and David (1994); Baker and Cunningham (2006); Tsai (2012); Filippov (2014);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study: \n\n*Countries in which academic researchers must acquire the express consent of rights holders to conduct lawful Data Mining (DM), exhibit  a  significantly  lower  share of  DM  research  output  relative  to  total  research  output. \n\n*The number of research articles is a reasonable indicator of innovation by academic researchers. This  may be  the first instance  where  an  empirical  study identifies a  significant negative association between copyright protection and the supply of new copyright works of any type. \n\n*Regarding DM research, copyright seems to have a negative net effect on innovation.\n\n*Attribution rights are relatively important for academic researchers whereas  commercial  rights  regarding  the  reproduction,  making  available  and  application  of research  results  are  less  important.  Our  results  on  the  relationship  between  DM  in  academic research and relevant copyright policy may not generalize to other copyright industries.\n\n* Incentives  to  publish  data suitable for follow-up research requires further attention\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The focus on patents is too narrow, as trademarks and copyright are far more widely used formal IP rights than patents.  Similarly, secrecy is not the most effective and frequently used informal appropriation method. The narrow focus of the theoretical literature creates a gap between the theoretical models and the empirical work in this area\n\n* From a policy point of view, the lack of a better theoretical understanding of the trade-off that companies face when choosing between the large range formal and informal IP methods represents a challenge.\n\n* The available empirical evidence strongly suggests that, in most industries, patents are not seen as an effective tool to appropriate returns to innovation. For policy, an improved understanding of possible interactions and overlaps between the different mechanisms would be useful.\n\n* Further research in the form of additional crosssectional survey evidence may not be the best way forward.

The Role of Restrictiveness of Use in Determining Ethical and Legal Awareness of Unauthorized File Sharing. Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 14(9), 521-549.\n|Abstract=A host of different types of information goods are available for free download from illegal file sharing sites. As far as price is concerned, no company can compete against “free.” Hence, managers, researchers, and policy makers are interested in determining factors other than price that might influence consumers’ file sharing behavior. Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers’ perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities. We find the relationships are significant even when controlling for several other elements such as gender, age, income, and prior knowledge about how and where to go on the internet to participate in file sharing.\n|Authentic Link=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&sid=630b348e-c803-41b1-b576-92fa8f8620a8%40sessionmgr112&hid=101&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1311988\n|Reference=Coyle, Gould, Gupta and Gupta (2009); Gopal, Bhattacharjee and Sanders (2006); Gupta, Gould and Pola (2004); Cheng, Sims and Teegen (1996); Levin, Dato-On and Rhee (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of studies:\n\n*The results of our three studies consistently demonstrate that typical people do not think file sharing is unethical per se, or even illegal per se.\n\n*People often do not really know whether file sharing is ethical and/or legal and they  make judgments based on the particular circumstances and their own limited, or nonexistent, copyright law expertise.\n\n*Subjects with similar personal moral development assigned different ethical and legal dimensions to different stages of perceived property rights transfer. That is, the perceived restrictiveness of a transfer (i.e., streaming a song online versus listening to a tangible CD) affected consumers’ ethical and legal stances. \n\n*This suggests that many consumers may feel they are acting consistently with their ethical and legal views when they participate in forms of unauthorized file sharing because they do not “see” a “physical” transfer of property rights. \n\n*Variation in ethical and legal perceptions arises not only between individuals, but also between circumstances.\n\n*Not only are more consumers likely to view situations that are more restrictive as ethical, but they are more likely to participate in those situations.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The results suggest that most consumers view that there ethically and legally should be some allowance for subsequent reuse, but that such reuse should also have boundaries. Further research is needed to more clearly establish what the boundaries are for restrictiveness of use.\n\n*Industry practitioners attempting to develop campaigns based on the results contained in this article should be aware that research has found that consumers more often follow social norms rather than requests from corporations. this should have some bearing on the design of advertising campaigns.\n\n*Consumers’ restrictiveness judgments appear to be compounded by notions of “time” and “location”. That is, while most consumers believe in something like the hypernorm “thou shalt not steal," stealing, as an activity, becomes increasingly fuzzy in intellectual property rights that are (for the most part) bound by time and location (i.e., geography).\n\n*A more-effective approach to limiting file sharing is to educate people about how much they are really sharing and with whom they are really sharing.\n|Description of Data=Theory Development: Thirty-four undergraduate students participated in one of two focus groups at different U.S. universities on consumer media file sharing exchanges in partial fulfillment of a course requirement.\n\nStudy 1: Respondents comprised 473 consumers from 20 states in the United States (out of approximately 600 invited, for a 77% response rate) who completed the within-sample experimental design study.

The purpose is to identify areas for further research that could inform copyright policy. Copyright defines the rough equivalent to property in many literary, scientific and artistic creations. The copyright system is a central component ofthe creative industries, including suppliers of computer software, movies, books, newspapers and magazines or recorded music among others. Copyright is also a major influence on the formation of so-called ‘digital’ markets for information goods and services, affecting much ofthe IT sector. Even though copyright has been part of US federal law for over 200 years  and similar arrangements existed even longer in major European countries there is relatively little systematic, empirical evidence on the economic effects of copyright. If anything, that should make the studies reviewed here more valuable. The structure ofthis report derives from the following basic economic analysis\n|Link=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063399.pdf\n|Reference=Towse (2010)\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The effect of file sharing on the copyright industries are varied depending on industry.

Columbia Journal of Law & the Arts, 37(1).\n|Abstract=Over the last decade, the problem of orphan works — i.e., copyrighted works whose owners cannot be located by a reasonably diligent search — has come sharply into focus as libraries, archives, and other large repositories of copyrighted works have sought to digitize and make available their collections online. Although this problem is certainly not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do not make their collections available at all.\n\nIn October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined with the Copyright Office’s remedy limitation approach, are better approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than alternatives proposed elsewhere. Finally, we explore future-looking changes, such as the reintroduction of copyright formalities and the development of registries, that would reduce the number of orphan works in the future.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2323945\n|Reference=Hansen (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Across the spectrum of works held, the numbers of suspected orphans is reported to be large:\n** of 548,000 artworks – 20 to 25% are orphaned\n** of 750,000 sound recording (hrs) – 5 to 10% are orphaned\n** of 21,800,000 commercial film (hrs) – 0 to 7% are orphaned\n** of 513,000 archive fil (hrs) – 5 to 35% are orphaned\n** of more than 100,000,000 photo libraries – approximately 0% are orphaned\n** of 28,280,000 archive photos – 5 to 90% are orphaned\n** of 10,400,000 written material – 4 to 30% are orphaned\n** of 38,000,000 mixed collections – 8 to 40% are orphaned\n* There is clear evidence that the orphan works problem stifles libraries and archives’ efforts to effectively use their collections and prevents those organizations from fulfilling their mission of making collections available for research and scholarship.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Despite a substantial literature on the effects of piracy on demand for recorded music, information on the supply effects of digital copying is limited. This paper presents empirical evidence that digital copying has not reduced the supply of new, copyrighted sound recordings in Germany. Even with a strong reduction in sales of sound recordings that accompanied the diffusion of digital copying technology, the annual number of new titles released to the market continued to expand. Results indicate that the number of new titles released has not deviated significantly from a long-term upward trend. The paper also presents evidence that the amount of time listening to sound recordings has not fallen over this period, suggesting no strong decline in the quality of new work.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2129141\n|Reference=Pietz and Waelbroeck (2004); Zentner (2005); Liebowitz (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Waldfogel (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The analysis found no significant impact of digital copying and severe sales declines between 1999 and 2006 on the number of new titles supplied in the German market for sound recordings. \n* Eight years into the recession, the number of new titles supplied continued to expand.

Economics of copyright collecting societies. International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law 38.8 (2007): 937-957.\n|Abstract=Economists have long recognised that copyright collecting societies (CCS), i.e. organisations that specialise on administering "copyrights held by a large number of owners", play a fundamental role in the copyright system. Indeed, the economic literature explains why without such organisations, copyright law would be ineffective in some markets for copyrighted works: the majority of authors and users would not be able to grant or obtain permission to use many works of art, literature, music, film and other such works that copyright law protects. In economic terms, CCS enable markets to function for the use of copyright works in situations in which the copyright holder cannot contract directly with the user. But because many markets for copyright works have changed rapidly over recent years, we should ask under which circumstances CCS would continue to play a constructive, maybe even essential, role. It has been argued many times that technical solutions to digital rights management (DRM) will render CCS obsolete as the market for copyrights shifts online and policy-makers such as the European Commission have begun to scrutinise the role played by CCS in the dynamic market for copyrighted media content online (REC 2005/737/EC). The purpose of this survey of the specialised economic literature is to take stock and to identify possible gaps in the understanding of the economics of CCS and to advocate attention to this literature in contemporary debates about them.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1159085\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1159085\n|Reference=Merges (1996); Watt (2000); Besen and Kirby (1989); Kretschmer (1999); Towse (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Collecting societies are an efficient way of distributing remittances for copyright to artists by minimising individual transaction costs\n* Collecting societies tend to operate as a monopoly or a bilateral monopoly but despite this the pricing of  content licenses tends to be set at a point chosen by the market\n* Digital Rights Management may be able to take over some of the functions of collecting agencies in the future\n* Various for-profit organisations seek to enter the market of collecting license fees but despite increasing competition this is unlikely to result in fairer pricing\n|FundamentalIssue=3.

We show that enlarging the copyright holder's captive market through more extensive copyright enforcement reduces prices toward the monopoly level, increases sales of legitimate copies and can increase consumer surplus. Therefore, in contrast with the case of more intensive copyright enforcement, more extensive copyright enforcement over some range can increase the incentive to generate intellectual property while also reducing the loss to consumers from monopoly power.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6451.2010.00419.x/abstract\n|Reference=Besen and Kirby (1989); Chen and Png (2003); Landes and Posner (1989); Takeyama (1997); Banerjee, Banerjee, and Raychaudhuri (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Broad-based and targeted copyright enforcement have very different implications for firm pricing strategies, piracy and social welfare. We have focused on copyright enforcement, but targeted enforcement may also be relevant for patent and trademark enforcement.\nEnforcement imposes a piracy cost which can be viewed as either paid by the bootleggers or by the consumers of pirated copies. In either case, consumer receives surplus from acquiring a pirated copy in the competitive bootlegger market. \nTargeted enforcement of copyright towards high value customers while allowing piracy for the low value customers allows surplus to flow to both copyright holder and consumer - copyright holder in the form of protecting the income for the legitimate copy and consumers overall as the existence of pirated copies ensures the legitimate copy is priced lower due to the competition.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Specifically, does it matter if the source of advice has a stake in the outcome of the piracy decision? Does it matter if the source of advice has a social tie with the advisee? Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen's parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game—The Piracy Game—extended from the volunteer's dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child's behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy. Our analyses not only provide managerial insights but also develop theoretical understanding of the role of social ties in the context of advice.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222310208\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Hashim/publication/228296003_Digital_Piracy_Teens_and_the_Source_of_Advice_An_Experimental_Study/links/02e7e533ec34a6adfd000000.pdf\n|Reference=Anderson (1995); Gopal and Sanders (1997); Sundararajan (2004); Bochet et al.

Yet, there is little analysis done on the implication of the educational strategies. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the implications of the source of advice on both pirating and purchasing decisions. The study is among the first to include both parents and their children in a behavioral/experimental economics study.\n\n- Results indicate that when there is a tangible stake for the parent for their child’s actions, purchasing behavior by the child is significantly increased, and pirating behavior is slightly decreased.\n\n- Even when there is not a stake for the parents (e.g., potential litigation), the advice is most effective when the advisor has a stronger social tie (parent as opposed to the record label or a regulator). On the contrary, when the record label provides advice, the profit generated surprisingly results in the worst outcome.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

We study the biographical Wikipedia pages of a large data set of authors, composers, and lyricists to determine whether the public domain status of available images leads to a higher rate of inclusion of illustrated supplementary material and whether such inclusion increases visitorship to individual pages. We attempt to objectively place a value on the body of public domain photographs and illustrations which are used in this global resource. We find that the most historically remote subjects are more likely to have images on their web pages because their biographical life-spans pre-date the existence of in-copyright imagery. We find that the large majority of photos and illustrations used on subject pages were obtained from the public domain, and we estimate their value in terms of costs saved to Wikipedia page builders and in terms of increased traffic corresponding to the inclusion of an image. Then, extrapolating from the characteristics of a random sample of a further 300 Wikipedia pages, we estimate a total value of public domain photographs on Wikipedia of between $246 to $270 million dollars per year.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2560572\n|Reference=Pollock (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Rogers and Szamosszegi (2010); Siwek (2013); Heald (2014);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The reservoir of free public domain works increases the likelihood that an author web page will contain an image.

However, the most of technological protection measures used so far were quickly circumvented after their introduction. This led to the development and use of more and more advanced technological protection measures, which were also quickly circumvented after their introduction. Therefore, the conventional view on the efficiency of using technological protection measures is that their use leads to a vicious circle of their circumvention and upgrading. \n\nTo examine the efficiency of technological protection measures, we conducted an online survey in Japan. A random sample of 1,252 internet users was asked to respond to a series of multiple-choice questions on their consumption of copyrighted works and their acceptance of or objection to selected restrictions on various uses of copyrighted works. By analyzing collected data, we identified that an individual’s decision on the acceptance or rejection of such technological and other restrictions on using copyrighted works is affected by factors such as gender, type of copyrighted works, perception of justified use, and actual use of copyright works. In addition, we observed considerable differences between the importance of individual types of copyrighted works and their uses for consumers. Some types of copyrighted works and their uses were more important for respondents than others. In many cases, the respondents’ judgments were consistent with the current copyright law and practice in Japan. However, there are several significant issues where their judgment considerably differs, especially with regard to recent changes in Japanese copyright law aiming to strengthen copyright enforcement in the digital environment. This can considerably undermine the efficiency of those changes in copyright law.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.serci.org/2013/hazucha-serci-2013.pdf\n|Reference=Samuelson (1999); Besek (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Results showed that the most problematic restriction in respondents’ opinions was on time-shifting of broadcasted TC programs.

A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth,\n|Abstract=When the Prime Minister commissioned this review in November 2010, he did so in terms which some considered provocative. The Review was needed, the PM said, because of the risk that the current intellectual property framework might not be sufficiently well designed to promote innovation and growth in the UK economy.\n\nIn the five months we have had to compile the Review, we have sought never to lose sight of David Cameron’s “exam question”. Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators’ rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth?\n\nThe short answer is: yes. We have found that the UK’s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that we must put our hugely important creative industries at risk. Indeed, these businesses too need change, in the form of more open, contestable and effective global markets in digital content and a setting in which enforcement of copyright becomes effective once more.\n\nThe Review sets out how this can be achieved. We have focused upon the main issues, at the risk of ignoring important points of detail, and have tried to set out a clear, strategic argument, supported with just ten recommendations. We are also making available online a number of documents which explore the available evidence and submissions made to the Review. If the Review’s recommendations are followed, the result will be more innovation and more economic growth.\n\nOur intellectual property framework will face further significant pressure to adapt in the coming years, as we make our way into the third decade of the commercial internet. We urge Government to ensure that in future, policy on Intellectual Property issues is constructed on the basis of evidence, rather than weight of lobbying, and to ensure that the institutions upon which we depend to deliver intellectual property policy have clear mandates and adaptive capability. Without that, the pile of IP reviews on the Government’s doorstep – four in the last six years – will continue to accumulate.\n|Authentic Link=http://autoblog.leslibres.org/autoblogs/creativecommonsorgweblog_6f7623748a4b5ddd872fd8c2fcd53404e0e69a8a/media/16ae12ee.ipreview-finalreport.pdf\n|Link=http://autoblog.leslibres.org/autoblogs/creativecommonsorgweblog_6f7623748a4b5ddd872fd8c2fcd53404e0e69a8a/media/16ae12ee.ipreview-finalreport.pdf\n|Reference=Gowers (2006); Farooqui, Goodridge and Haskel (2011); Greenhalgh and Rogers (2010); Handke (2010); Hunt, Williams, Nicholas and Rowlands (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The UK’s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. \n\n* Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. \n\n* Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. \n\n* The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n\nThe review made 10 main policy recommendations that can be found below.\n|FundamentalIssue=1. Relationship between protection (subject matter/term/scope) and supply/economic development/growth/welfare, 3.

Effects of protection on industry structure (e.g. oligopolies; competition; economics of superstars; business models; technology adoption),\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=A.

Exceptions (distinguish innovation and public policy purposes; open-ended/closed list; commercial/non-commercial distinction), C. Mass digitisation/orphan works (non-use; extended collective licensing),\n|Discipline=A1: General Economics\n|Intervention-Response=This review (widely referred to as Hargreaves Review) makes 10 distinct policy recommendations. A number of these a concerned largely with issues surrounding patent law. However, the majority are relevant to copyright policy.\n\n1. Evidence: Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights.\n\n2. International priorities: The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the Patent Cooperation Treaty a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications.\n\n3. Copyright licensing:\n• In order to boost UK firms’ access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice.\n• The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. Collecting societies should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets.\n\n4. Orphan works: The Government should legislate to enable licensing of orphan works. This should establish extended collective licensing for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange.\n\n5. Limits to copyright: Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including format shifting, parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and data analytics. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract.\n\n6. Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation: In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should:\n• take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending “work sharing” with patent offices in other countries;\n• work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit;\n• investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of patent thickets, including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets.\n\n7. The design industry: The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs.\n\n8. Enforcement of IP rights: The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the DEA becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court.\n\n9. Small firm access to IP advice: The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice.\n\n10. An IP system responsive to change: The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UK’s IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government.\n|Description of Data=The Hargreaves Review covers the 4 core elements of IP: Copyright, Designs, Patents and Trademarks.\n\nThe review draws on a broad range of primary (research commissioned for the report and responses to calls for evidence) and secondary sources.\n\nThe primary source data includes research commissioned by Hargreaves including: Greenhalgh & Rogers (2011), PACEC (2011) The VoD Sector and TNS-BMRB (2011). \n\nIn addition to this commissioned research the review issued a call for evidence. This elicited submissions from individuals (including creators, representatives and academics) to those made by corporate stakeholders (collecting societies, public sector organisation and trade bodies among others). In addition to the call for evidence the review conducted a number of meetings and engagement events with stakeholders both in the UK and the USA.\n\nThe secondary source data is largely drawn from two distinct types of source: previous policy reports (e.g. Commission on\nIntellectual Property Rights (2002), Gowers (2006), previous academic research and industry data (e.g. annual statements, industry generated research).\n\nIn general the review finds significant obstacles to constructing a comprehensive evidence base for IP policy. \n\n"There are three main practical obstacles to using evidence on the economic impacts of IP:\n\n• There are areas of IPRs on which data is simply difficult to assemble. While patents are well documented, and traceable to their owners, unregistered design rights and copyright use are not.\n• The most controversial policy questions usually arise in areas (such as computer programs, digital communication and biosciences) which are new and inherently uncertain because they involve new technologies or new markets whose characteristics are not well understood or measured.\n• Much of the data needed to develop empirical evidence on copyright and designs is privately held. It enters the public domain chiefly in the form of “evidence” supporting the arguments of lobbyists (“lobbynomics”) rather than as independently verified research conclusions."\n|Data Year=2010-2011\n\nPre-2011\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=SABIP; European Commission; Office for National Statistics; WIPO; NESTA;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Qualitative Collection Methods\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Qualitative Analysis Methods\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Software publishing (including video games); Film and motion pictures; Television programmes; Sound recording and music publishing; Programming and broadcasting; Computer programming; Specialised design; Photographic activities; Translation and interpretation; Cultural education; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=UK;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=HM Treasury;\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2318, 'title': 'Hargreaves, I.', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2623, 'title': 'Hazlett, TW', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

J. (2014). How Notice-and-Takedown Regimes Create Markets for Music on Youtube: An Empirical Study. UMKC L. Rev., 83, 313.\n|Abstract=In theory, notice-and-takedown regimes can lower transaction costs by facilitating communication between users and copyright owners, especially where content filtering automates much of the process. This market study tests the transaction costs theory by tracking 90 songs on YouTube that reached number one on the U.S., French, and Brazilian pop charts from 1930 to 1960. The data collected includes the identity of the uploader, type of upload, number of views, date of upload, and monetization status. YouTube uploads of a sample of 385 popular songs from 1919-1926 are also charted. An analysis of the data demonstrates that the DMCA safe harbor system as applied to YouTube helps maintain public access to many old songs by allowing those possessing copies (primarily infringers) to communicate relatively costlessly with copyright owners to satisfy the market of potential listeners.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2416519\n|Plain Text Proposition=Economists are sometimes overly-effusive in their praise of the wisdom of common law rules, but in the case of YouTube, established principles of secondary liability (as embodied in the DMCA) facilitate the development and creation of a more efficient market. Courts have so far usually held that market-making intermediaries not liable for the maintenance of platforms that welcome infringers until those intermediaries have actual knowledge of the infringement.\n\nIn this way, the rules that encourage takedown and notice regimes help promote access to cultural works while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of rights holders. These rules,however, are under attack as advocates push for a strict liability regime that would destroy the market just described.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 31-54, 2012; Illinois Public Law Research Paper No. 11-23.\n|Abstract=A previous empirical study suggested that as copyrighted songs transitioned into the public domain they were used just as frequently in movie soundtracks as when they were still legally protected. That study, however, did not account for the number people who viewed each movie in the theater. Since the debate over copyright term extension centers on the continuing “availability” of works as they fall into the public domain, a better measure of the availability of songs in movies would account for the relative box office success of the movies in which the songs appear. The present study collects box office data for hundreds of movies from 1968-2008 in which appeared hundreds of songs and concludes that public domain songs were heard by just as many people in movie theaters before and after they fell into the public domain.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2080184\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003); Heald (2008); Heald (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This paper examines accounts for the number tickets sold in order to measure popularity, and therefore the number of viewers of each movie while it played in theatres. More specifically, this paper shows that: \n* For both copyrighted songs and public domain songs, availability measured by ticket sales of movies using the songs increases by year.\n* The evidence does not show that availability is significantly influenced by the legal status of a song.\n* The inclusion of box office data and Billboard data into the analysis of song availability supports the conclusion reached by Heald (2009) that songs remain just as available to the public after they fall into the public domain.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

This paper presents new data on how copyright stifles the reappearance of works. First, a random sample of more than 2000 new books for sale on Amazon.com is analyzed along with a random sample of almost 2000 songs available on new DVD’s. Copyright status correlates highly with absence from the Amazon shelf. Together with publishing business models, copyright law seems to deter distribution and diminish access. Further analysis of eBook markets, used books on Abebooks.com, and the Chicago Public library collection suggests that no alternative marketplace for out-of-print books has yet developed. Data from iTunes and YouTube, however, tell a different story for older hit songs. The much wider availability of old music in digital form may be explained by the differing holdings in two important cases Boosey & Hawkes v. Disney (music) and Random House v. Rosetta Stone (books).\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12057/abstract;jsessionid=F0844D0DD294965CD748AF5B419FB030.f02t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2290181\n|Reference=Heald (2008); Buccafusco and Heald (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Editions of books now in the public domain (published before 1923) constitute 72% of the total while editions of titles under copyright constitute 28%.\n\n* Public domain books averaged 4 times more editions per title than the copyrighted books. \n\n* The effect of copyright law on the availability of music as it appears on new DVDs sold by Amazon is also negative, but not as negative as books. \n\n* Three times as many 60 to 80 year-old public domain songs were used in movies than those in the same category still protected by copyright.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

And of those 45 copyrighted eBooks, only one was out-of-print in hard copy format.\n* On average out-of-print NYTBR titles from the 1930’s, 1940’s and 1960’s had approximately enough used volumes available to satisfy the needs of a single classroom (around 30 per title).

Some theories for this discrepancy are offered.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409118\n|Reference=Heald (2008); Smith, Telang, and Zhang (2012); Heald (2013); Rosen (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Of the 292 NYTBR books (31%) that are currently out-of-print, only 26 (9%) were available for purchase as an eBook in January 2014. \n* Only 27% of bestselling books from 1923-32 have been published as eBooks, while 84% of bestselling music from the same era can e bought in digital form on iTunes. \n* By contrast, the cost of digitizing music, the lower barriers to digitization, and the significantly shorter time for and ease of consumption might explain why the market for older music is more robust than the market for older books.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Others insist instead that without an owner to control their use, valuable public domain works will be overexploited or otherwise debased. This study of the most valuable musical compositions from 1913-32 demonstrates that neither hypothesis is true as it applies to the exploitation of songs in movies from 1968-2007. When compositions fall into the public domain, they are more likely to be exploited in movies, suggesting no under-exploitation. And the rate of exploitation of these public domain songs is no greater than that of copyrighted songs, indicating no congestion externality. The absence of market failure is likely due to producer and consumer self-regulation.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1115405\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003); Liebowitz and Margolis (2004); Heald (2008a);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Public domain songs are exploited at statistically the same rate as copyrighted songs, indicating that in this context worries of both over- and under-exploitation are misplaced.\n\n* When compositions fall into the public domain, they are more likely to be exploited in movies, suggesting no under-exploitation.\n\n* Results obtained with a logistic regression analysis to control for time-period effects suggest that copyright status plays no significant role in affecting the probability of a song’s appearance in a film.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2007). Consumer file sharing of motion pictures. Journal of Marketing, 71(4), 1-18.\n|Abstract=Illegal consumer file sharing of motion pictures is considered a major threat to the movie industry. Whereas industry advocates and some scholars postulate a cannibalistic effect on commercial forms of movie consumption, other researchers deny this effect, though sound evidence is lacking on both sides. Drawing on extant research and utility theory, the authors present hypotheses on the consequences and determinants of consumer file sharing and test them with data from a controlled longitudinal panel study of German consumers. The data contain information on the consumers' intentions toward and actual behavior in relation to the consumption of 25 new motion pictures, allowing the authors to study more than 10,000 individual file-sharing opportunities. The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of consumer file sharing. They find evidence of substantial cannibalization of theater visits, DVD rentals, and DVD purchases responsible for annual revenue losses of $300 million in Germany. Five categories of file-sharing behavior drive file sharing and have a significant impact on how consumers obtain and watch illegal movie copies.\n|Authentic Link=http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.4.1\n|Link=http://facultynh.syr.edu/bjsheeha/Research%20Projects/music%20download%20research/music%20download%20project/articles%20for%20music%20download/Hennig-Thureau%202007%5B1%5D.pdf\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2005); Gopal, Bhattacharjee, and Sanders (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Through the longitudinal study, the following statistics were produced:\n** Of the 25 movies in the sample, 136 respondents (17%) had obtained at least one illegal copy before the movies were released on DVD; 242 illegal movie copies had been obtained by that time and 165 of these copies had been watched. \n** Respondents intended to watch an illegal copy in 21.1% of cases before the theatrical release and 13.1% of cases before the DVD release. \n** After the movies were released to DVD, 141 respondents (18.5%) had obtained at least one copy of a surveyed movie; overall 342 illegal movie copies had been obtained by the time of the third survey, and 66% of those illegal copies had been watched. At this point, the maximum number of illegal copies that individual respondents obtained was 11. \n* Consumers’ intentions to view an illegal copy of a new movie reduce their propensity to attend theaters. This suggests that file-sharing intentions limit the consumer’s interest in legal channel consumption, which in turn leads him to forgo consumption in these channels, regardless of whether the consumer actually obtains an illegal copy of the movie or not. \n* Consumers’ intentions to watch a movie copy significantly reduce their number of DVD rentals and purchases. \n* Researchers calculated an overall annual industry loss of $300 million in Germany, which represents approximately 9.4% of the total industry revenues in 2005.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Therefore, decreasing consumers’ intentions to watch illegal movie copies may be the most powerful way to fight movie piracy. \n* Making movies available through new channels, such as video-on-demand that involve lower transaction costs than trips to the theater (including babysitters and concession prices, etc.), might be an appropriate way to win back transaction cost-sensitive consumers.\n|Description of Data=Study employed controlled longitudinal panel data from 770 to 813 consumers that encompass information on more than 10,000 movie file-sharing opportunities. Researchers collected information from a quota sample of 1075 German consumers using gender, age, and occupation as quota criteria to represent the key demographic variables of movie consumption. Respondents filled out three different Internet questionnaires over the course of eight months, for which they received 10 Euro. \n\nRespondents were contacted in February 2006 and questioned as to whether or not they intended to watch between 10 to 15 new motion pictures out of a subset of 25 movies in a movie theater or as an illegal copy. \n\nRespondents were contacted again in May 2005 to determine whether they had seen the previously surveyed movies in theaters and/or obtained illegal copies. 813 panel members responded, for a satisfactory retention rate of 76%.\n\nA third questionnaire followed in October 2005, after 18 of the 25 movies had been available on DVD for at least for weeks.

We build on an Internet survey (N=6,083) we conducted to Finnish users in 2007. Using the survey data we examine how the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics associate the file-sharing. We also examine whether knowledge of law has any impact on file-sharing behaviour. We find that the frequent and the infrequent P2P-users share several common attributes with each other. Frequent users are clearly more often male than female, are younger, and possess lower educational qualifications than infrequent users. The results also indicate that the people who are active in P2P-users have weaker legal knowledge about digital copyright issues. The findings and the use of the survey method carry implications for legal and social science scholar work that examines the illegal file-sharing phenomenon.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1414209\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pekka_Raesaenen/publication/228189633_Reasons_Affecting_Frequency_of_File-Sharing_among_Finnish_Internet_Users/links/02bfe50f5b3ab44be5000000.pdf\n|Reference=Hietanen, Huttunen and Kokkinen (2007); Hietanen, Huttunen and Kokkinen (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Frequent P2P file-sharers / downloaders are:\n* Significantly likely more often to be male than female – 2.4:1 in this sample\n* Significantly more likely to be in a younger age group (age ≤ 24) when compared with those in the oldest age group (age > 35)\n* More likely to have lower educational qualifications than infrequent P2P users\n* More likely to have weaker legal knowledge about digital copyright issues than infrequent P2P users.\n\nThose who disagree with the statement that it is condemnable to share unauthorized files are much more likely (3.5:1) to be frequent P2P users than those who agree. In addition, those respondents who feel neutral about this statement are also more often frequent users when compared to disagreeing respondents (almost 1.9:1).\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

However, this might be an impossible task, partly because illegal file sharing is experienced as either as a victimless crime, or one where the victim is seen as a rich and remote “Hollywood star”.\n\nThe results partly explain why the Pirate movement in Scandinavia has its strongest support in its youth chapters. Young adults don’t have moral obstacles when demanding the legalisation of file sharing, and don’t see that their actions cause harm. This is the reason why rights owners’ attempts to change moral values has had only a limited impact on file sharing.\n|Description of Data=6,083 complete responses from P2P survey data collected by Hietanen, Huttunen and Kokkinen (2007), through a questionnaire on three online newspaper sites, Sep-Oct 2007.

The results show that low self control, an association with deviant peers, previous patterns of movie piracy behaviour and attitudes toward software piracy will have significant additive effects with the intention to commit movie piracy. The study adds to established understanding of factors relevant to the likelihood of an individual to engage in movie piracy as follows: \n\n* The self control of an individual is an important individual-level factor that influences the intention to pirate movies. An individual with low self control has a greater propensity to commit movie piracy;\n\n* Both an individual's association with movie pirating peers and their own positive software pirating attitudes influence their intention to pirate movies; \n\n* Moral beliefs did not have a link with the likelihood of an individual to engage in movie piracy, which is inconsistent with previous research;\n\n* When substantial association with movie pirating peers and positive attitudes toward software piracy combine, low self control has its strongest impact on movie piracy likelihood;\n\n* An individuals's prior movie piracy has its strongest relative impact on movie piracy likelihood when substantial association with movie-pirating peers and positive software piracy attitudes combine.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The foregoing will educate students that their behaviour is wrong and avoid possible transference of movie piracy behaviour to other criminal behaviours. It may also restore student inhibitions to carrying out movie piracy that have previously been removed.\n|Description of Data=Field survey data from questionnaires completed by 338 students across four classes of the College of Arts of an Eastern U.S college in the academic semester of Autumn 2004.

Specifically, the study developed a three-factor model that indicated that low self-control, combined with social learning, could lead to digital piracy. This supports Hirschi and Gottfredson’s (1993) assertion that self-control is impacted by constraints. The constraint in this case is the need for individuals to learn how to perform digital piracy. The authors suggest that universities seeking to reduce digital piracy should consider developing policies and programs based on social learning theory. Participants were 392 college students who completed a self-report questionnaire measuring aspects of social control, association with digital pirating peers, attitudes toward software piracy, and intentions to commit digital piracy. The analysis involved the use of structural equation modeling to test how four models of low self-control and social learning combined to produce the commission of digital piracy. Future research should use different measures of digital piracy and should consider the theoretical links that low self-control has with other theories in terms of their contribution to explaining digital piracy. Future research should also consider using a longitudinal design.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=235983\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/249018603_Digital_Piracy_Assessing_the_Contributions_of_an_Integrated_SelfControl_Theory_and_Social_Learning_Theory_Using_Structural_Equation_Modeling\n|Reference=Akers (1998); Gopal et al (2004); Hirschi and Gottfredson (1993); Higgins and Makin (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The purpose of the present study was to shed light on an emerging form of white-collar crime like digital piracy by applying crime theories. The study examined the links between self-control theory and social learning theory and digital piracy. \n\n4 models are used in the paper: \n# The first model produces confirmatory factor analysis to assess the construct validity;\n# Second structural model is examined to find out if the link between low self-control and digital piracy is mediated by social learning theory;\n# Third model finds low self-control and social learning theory have independent direct links with digital piracy;\n# Fourth model finds that low self-control has an indirect effect on digital piracy, but low self-control maintains a direct effect on digital piracy.\n\n* That is, low self-control and social learning theory have independent direct links with digital piracy (Model Three). Further, low self-control has an indirect effect on digital piracy, but low self-control maintains a direct effect on digital piracy (Model Four).\n\n* The study provides evidence that low self-control, social learning theory, and digital piracy have a link. Specifically, the results suggest that the link between low self-control and digital piracy is partially mediated by social learning theory.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This study examines the link that Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) idea of low self-control has with software piracy. Using a non random sample of college students and measures of low self-control, software pirating peers, software pirating attitudes, and moral beliefs toward software piracy, the findings show that low self-control has a link with software piracy.

First, the present study is designed to provide additional information about the link between off-line and virtual peers and music piracy. Second, the present study provides information about how off-line and virtual peers interact with self-control to understand music piracy. The results of this study show that low self-control has a link with digital piracy. This means that individuals who cannot resist temptation and do not see the consequences of their action have an increased likelihood to perform digital piracy, which is consistent with a growing literature in this area (Higgins et al. 2006; Higgins and Makin 2004a, 2004b; Higgins and Wilson 2006).\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.2011.584275\n|Link=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDYQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F239793598_Examining_the_Role_of_Peer_Influence_and_Self-Control_on_Downloading_Behavior&ei=1YRjVZv0CsHbUZWkgtgG&usg=AFQjCNF-ttvhy-uvY_nPuYa8lXumVY0QvQ&bvm=bv.93990622,d.d24\n|Reference=Morris and Higgins (2009); Gopal et al (2004); Akers (1998); Wall (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Results\n* The results of this study show that low self-control has a link with digital piracy.\n* The result that peer association has a link with digital piracy, so  associating with off-line peers who download music illegally resulted in an increased likelihood in one engaging in the same behavior.\n* Results suggest that the premise that self-control is the only reason why criminal behavior occurs is not completely correct.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The results indicate three separate classes for each form of digital piracy and different profiles for each form of piracy. Actual piracy shows more demographic and social learning theory differences among individuals, whereas scenario-based digital piracy shows more self-control and social learning theory differences among individuals. A cross-tab analysis shows that there are differences between individuals who actually perform digital piracy and those who have the intention to pirate.

This study used short-term longitudinal data (i.e., once a week for 4 weeks) from undergraduate students (n = 292) and latent trajectory analysis. The results of this study revealed that the students had significant variability in initial levels and rates of change in digital piracy. The results indicated that whether motivation was treated as a time-invariant or time-varying measure, it along with sex (i.e., being male) had a significant link with the initial levels of digital piracy and that sex and low self-control had links with the rate of change.

Results also show that intention is far superior in the time-in-variant model in predicting trajectories of digital piracy.\n* The readiness to perform a behavior is statistically significant in each instance in predicting digital piracy.\n* Further, the results suggest that intentions (i.e., motivation) provide a stronger impact on the initial level and the rate of change of digital piracy.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2008). Deindividuation and internet software piracy. CyberPsychology & Behavior, 11(4), 391-398.\n|Abstract=Computer crime has increased exponentially in recent years as hardware, software, and network resources become more affordable and available to individuals from all walks of life. Software piracy is one prevalent type of cybercrime and has detrimentally affected the economic health of the software industry. Moreover, piracy arguably represents a rend in the moral fabric associated with the respect of intellectual property and reduces the financial incentive of product creation and innovation. Deindividuation theory, originating from the field of social psychology, argues that individuals are extricated from responsibility for their actions simply because they no longer have an acute awareness of the identity of self and of others. That is, external and internal constraints that would typically regulate questionable behavior are rendered less effective via certain anonymizing and disinhibiting conditions of the social and environmental context. This exploratory piece seeks to establish the role of deindividuation in liberating individuals to commit software piracy by testing the hypothesis that persons who prefer the anonymity and pseudonymity associated with interaction on the Internet are more likely to pirate software. Through this research, it is hoped that the empirical identification of such a social psychological determinant will help further illuminate the phenomenon.\n|Authentic Link=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2007.0048\n|Reference=Gergen et all (1973); Hinduja (2001); Hinduja (2003); Wallace (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article intends to obtain a greater understanding of the factors that influence the commission of software piracy.

The extant knowledgebase on why individuals take part in this form of intellectual property is growing, but little is known about the type and background of those involved. This study therefore seeks to construct a profile of the typical music pirate by measuring the salience of demographic characteristics and the respondent’s scope of overall participation in cyberspace-based activities. Findings indicated that respondents’ differentially participated in music piracy based on their gender, race, type of college major, proficiency in using the Internet, and variety of online participation.

Social learning theory and music piracy: the differential role of online and offline peer influences. Criminal Justice Studies, 22(4), 405-420.\n|Abstract=Social learning theory has been proven to demonstrate much explanatory value in the study of software and music piracy that occurs over the Internet. As a multifaceted predictive framework, though, the salience of some of the theory’s individual components has yet to be empirically measured. Answering the call of recent research to do just that, the current study seeks to identify the differential impact of offline and online peer influences on participation in music piracy. Results based on data from a sample of approximately 2000 university students indicated real-life peers had the strongest effect, after controlling for individuals’ demographic characteristics and Internet capabilities. To a lesser degree, though, online peers and online media sources (e.g., chat rooms) were also found to significantly predict participation in music piracy. Suggestions for policy stemming from these findings are discussed in conclusion with the intent of sharpening response efforts to reduce intellectual property theft in cyberspace.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786010903358125\n|Reference=Akers (1998); Garner (1999); Gopal, Sanders, Bhattacharjee, Agrawal and Wagner (2004); Hinduja (2008); Ingram and Hinduja (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article discusses the concept of digital intellectual property and utilizes social learning theory in order to approach and understand music pirating behavior. It also tests the effects that real life peers and popular media sources as well as online peers and online media sources have on music piracy. More specifically, this article shows that: \n\n*With respect to the offline and online peer measures, the descriptive statistics indicate that students tended to associate with real life peers over online peers, and reported similar levels of agreement concerning the importance of popular media and online media in their influence on MP3 usage. When examining the correlations of the peer variables, real life peers had the strongest association with music piracy, followed by online peers and online media sources.\n\n*Being male and having higher levels of Internet-related skills were also strongly associated with music piracy.\n\n*Students who report being influenced by real life peers seem to be less influenced by other peer sources whether offline or online.\n\n*Students who reported learning the techniques from both online peers and online media sources had significantly higher music piracy scores.\n\n*Students with greater Internet skills and faster connectivity also had significantly higher piracy scores.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This paper outlines the structure \nand operation of entrepreneurial organizations in the most speculative segments of three cultural industries :  book publishing, phonograph records and motion pictures. Commercial "cultural" products are conceived as “non-material"  goods, directed at a mass public of consumers, for whom they serve an "esthetic," rather than  a clearly "utilitarian" purpose. Three adaptive "coping"  strategies are set forth and  examined:  the deployment of "contact" men to organizational boundaries; overproductioll and differential promotion of new items; and the  cooptation of mass media gatekeepers.  The concept of  an "industry system" is proposed as a useful frame of reference in which to trace the filtering of new products and ideas as they flow from producer to consumer, and in which to examine relations among organizations.  This substantive area, seldom viewed  from an organizational perspective, is then related to a growing body of literature in the sub-field of interorganizational relations.\n|Authentic Link=www.jstor.org/stable/2776751\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/247266573_Processing_Fads_and_Fashions_An_Organization-Set_Analysis_of_Cultural_Industry_Systems\n|Reference=Barnett (1953); Evan (1963); Blumer (1969);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The paper outline s the structure and operation of entrepreneurial organizations engaged in the production and mass distribution of three  types of "cultural" items:  books, recordings and  motion pictures.  Focusing  specifically on publishing houses, movie production companies and record companies.\nThe paper outlined 3 main strategies employed to limit dependence of elements in their “task environment” and to fight constraints on output distribution imposed by gatekeepers and contingencies in recruiting creative material. \n\n# Using contact men  in organisational boundaries:  The role of the contact men who are talent scouts, promoters, press agents etc. is to link cultural organisations with the artist community\n# Differential promotion of new items and overproduction:  This is in response to low capital investment and demand uncertainty. This causes resources such as promotional materials to be distributed unevenly with emphasis on only a few items. There is thus an expectation that many new cultural items will fail.\n# Cooptation of mass media gatekeepers: An example of this would be a record company advertising in the trade press or encouraging a gatekeeper, which could be a popular radio station, to cover their new artist. This however conflicts with the interest of the gatekeeper, because if done too much it could affect the reputation of the gatekeeper negatively.  \nThe authors conclude by introducing the concept of “industrial systems” as a frame of reference to trace the flow of  new products/ideas as they are filtered at each level or organisation and to examine  relationships among organisations.\n|FundamentalIssue=3.

Most of the studies examining cybercrime, however, have only used college samples. In addition, the evidence on the interaction between low self-control and deviant peer associations is mixed. Therefore, this study examined whether low self-control and deviant peer associations explained various forms of cyberdeviance in a youth sample. We also tested whether associating with deviant peers mediated the effect of low self-control on cyberdeviance as well as whether it conditioned the effect. Low self-control and deviant peer associations were found to be related to cyberdeviance in general, as well as piracy, harassment, online pornography, and hacking specifically. Deviant peer associations both mediated and exacerbated the effect of low self-control on general cyberdeviance, though these interactions were not found for the five cyberdeviant types examined.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-011-9117-3#page-1\n|Link=http://news.msu.edu/media/documents/2011/06/963e40c7-08ff-411d-af16-fe7563496f89.pdf\n|Reference=Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990); Akers (1998); Gopal, Sanders, Bhattacharjee, Agrawal and Wagner (2004); Higgins (2007); Gibson, Ward, Wright, Beaver and Delisi (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study found that deviant peer groups had a greater influence on illegal downloading of media than low self-control; non-deviant peer groups could mitigate some of the low self-control effect on cyberdeviance.

"Transferring subcultural knowledge on-line: Practices and beliefs of persistent digital pirates." Deviant Behavior 31.7 (2010): 625-654.\n|Abstract=Criminal subcultures form around deviant behaviors as a consequence of persistent interactions with like-minded others who facilitate the transmission of norms, values, and belief. Although researchers have explored social interactions in the real world, few have considered how learning occurs through virtual interactions. We address the role of on-line interactions in spreading subcultural knowledge by interviewing 34 persistent digital pirates and performing a non-participant ethnography of an on-line forum devoted to piracy. Our results show that through on-line interactions, pirates learn the norms and values of digital piracy, including how to recognize and avoid risks associated with pirating and how to make sense of and justify their actions. They did not see themselves as members of a piracy subculture, however. These findings show that subcultural knowledge can be transmitted through on-line interactions, even when participants do not fully invest in the group.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639620903231548#.VVonVPlViko\n|Reference=Cooper and Harrison (2001); Hinduja (2001); Furnell (2002); Holt (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Media pirates within hacker subculture share the belief that information should be shared and that illegal downloading is due to bad practices of record companies and does not harm the artist.  While they are aware of legal sanctions, these threats do not play a significant role in decision making.  Piracy is increasing and becoming more sophisticated; deviant behaviour will change to reflect changing technology.  Further, many within the hacking subculture identify more strongly with conventional society, partly due to ease of online participation, allowing spread of subculture values throughout society.  This also may explain the widespread neutralization of perceived illegality amongst media pirates.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Demand curves and profit\nmaximizing behaviors are analyzed. The price elasticity of piracy indicates that piracy is\ninsensitive to price cuts. The results have implications for the calculation of damages of\npiracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://swopec.hhs.se/lunewp/abs/lunewp2000_009.htm\n|Link=http://swopec.hhs.se/lunewp/abs/lunewp2000_009.htm\n|Reference=Cheng, Sims and Teegen (1997); Gopal and Sanders (1997); Besen and Kirby (1989); Johnson (1985);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results:\n\n*Only 2 % of the social science students are willing to pay the retail price if a copy is freely available, but the situation refers to a contingency where the subjects are supposed to be “very anxious” to get the program.\n\n*Only 31% of the social science students have an additional willingness to pay for originals (AWTPO) that is less than SEK 100 for the original with the retail price of SEK 1000. \n\n*Only 17% of the social science students have an AWTPO that is less than SEK 100 for the original with the retail price of SEK 3000. \n\nSubjects that are more computer skilled have on average a lower AWTPO than subjects that are less computer skilled. Furthermore, this difference seems to increase with the retail price of the original.\n\n*If the marginal cost were zero, optimal pricing would lead the firm to cut prices by 80%. Even if such a price cut were made almost 50% of the computer generation subjects would still get an illegal copy. If marginal cost is one fifth of the original retail price (i.e., SEK 200) optimal pricing lead the firm to cut prices by 50%. If this price cut were made 86% of the subjects would still get an illegal copy.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The price elasticity of piracy indicates that the piracy rate is quite insensitive to price cuts for most price intervals. This suggests that moderate price cuts are likely to be a rather inefficient method to fight piracy in the computer generation.\n\n*The author found that although a pricing option exists, price cuts would hardly delimit piracy to a larger extent and the extra revenues earned from groups inclined to piracy would be low due to very low optimal prices. If we take into account incentive compatibility constraints from other market segments with higher prices and time consistency constraints then these mechanisms would make the price cuts even less profitable.\n|Description of Data=A selected group of 330 Swedish undergraduate students filled in a Contingent Valuation questionnaire.

Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Discussion Paper No. 03-18.\n|Abstract=This paper quantifies the magnitude of changes in household-level expenditures on recorded music in the United States, particularly attributed to the emergence of Napster.Exploiting the rich information contained in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, I use three approaches to measure the effect of Napster. The difference-in-difference kernel matching (DDM) method directly quantifies the effect. I find that the quarterly music expenditure of the average\nU.S. household has declined by two dollars and forty-six cents as a result of using the Internet and plausibly Napster. This accounts for 33% of the decrease in total recording sales in 2000. The second approach estimates a demand system for entertainment goods. The estimated cross-price elasticities imply that changes in prices of other entertainment goods also explain the slump in recorded music sales. In 2000, roughly 37% of the decline in recording sales is due to such changes in prices. The final method constructs synthetic cohorts. The results indicate that transition from LPs to CDs might describe the increase in music sales during the 1990’s as well as the recent slowdown. These two other methods\nindirectly measure the effect of Napster in that they explicate that more than 80% of music sales decrease in 2000 might have resulted from factors aside from Napster. This implies that the estimated magnitude using DDM may quantify changes in the household-level music expenditure due to not only Napster but also factors other than file-sharing of copyrighted music.\n|Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.9026&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Reference=Angrist and Krueger (1992); Attanasio (1996); Attanasio (1988); Battistin (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The results of the study imply that the transition effect is consistent with the recent slowdown in the recording industry.\n\n* The quarterly music expenditure of the average U.S. household has declined by two dollars and forty-six cents as a result of using the Internet and, plausibly, starting to use Napster. This accounts for 33% of the decrease in total recording sales in 2000.\n\n* Changes in prices of other entertainment goods also explain the slump in recorded music sales. In 2000, roughly 37% of the decline in recording sales was due to such changes in prices.\n\n* The results indicate that transition from LPs to CDs might describe the increase in music sales during the 1990’s as well as the recent slowdown.

Applying a difference-in-differences approach to the\nConsumer Expenditure Survey, I find varying degrees of potential substitutability between Internet\ngrowth and consumer expenditures across different entertainment goods.

In the case of recorded music, books, and admissions to movies and concerts, the average expenditures for Internet users have decreased considerably, whereas the decline appears to be relatively moderate for other entertainment goods.\n\n*The decline in Internet users’ expenditures may simply reflect a common time trend. \n\n*The apparent negative correlations between the growth of the Internet and expenditures on most entertainment goods may be confounded by compositional changes in Internet users in that non-users who tend to spend less on entertainment may have begun to use the Internet over time. \n\n*Varying degrees of negative correlations across different entertainment goods may rather reflect changes in relative prices among these goods.\n\n*The author finds varying degrees of potential substitutability between Internet growth and consumer expenditures across different entertainment goods. The growth of the Internet therefore\nseems to have substituted for consumption of existing entertainment goods. \n\n*For most goods, these negative effects appear to be sensitive to changes in specifications.\n\n*In contrast, the negative effect on recorded music expenditure is significant and robust to different specifications.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Two commonly used software products, Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, were used in the study as objects to reveal consumer assessed values. A consumer survey was administered in Taiwan and the total valid samples were 799. Respondents in this study included students from senior high schools, colleges, and graduate schools, and general consumers who were no longer full-time students. The estimated average WTP for Windows was USD 58.55 and for Office was USD 53.49, much lower than the respective suggested retail prices in the market. Social norms had strong positive influences on willingness-to-pay for software products. The prosecution risk did not significantly increase WTPs for software products due to the reason that individuals who used pirated software were not at a high risk of being prosecuted. Performance risk was positively correlated to WTPs for software products. The respondents segmented into the low-WTP cluster were more likely to use pirated software than those in the high- WTP segment. Source reliability, legitimacy, technical support, and customer service were emphasized in decisions of respondents in the high-WTP segment and could be used in marketing strategies.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-007-9543-9\n|Reference=Ang, Cheng, Lim and Tambyah (2001); Chiou, Huang and Lee (2005); Wang, Zhang, Zang and Ouyang (2005); Wee, Tan and Cheok (1995);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article selects two commonly used commercial software products, Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, to examine consumers’ usage patterns of unauthorized software in addition to evaluating the dollar amount of willingness-to-pay (WTP) for these two software products.

The review was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 – the diagnostic phase – concluded that a number of issues existed with copyright licensing which meant that it was not entirely fit for purpose\nfor the digital age. Phase 2 – the solutions phase – sought to identify workable solutions to address the problems identified in Phase 1.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/Documents/dce-report-phase2.aspx\n|Link=http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/Documents/dce-report-phase2.aspx\n|Reference=Hargreaves (2011); Hooper and Lynch (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main recommendation of this report is the creation of a not-for-profit, industry led Copyright Hub based in the UK that links interoperably and scalably to the growing national and international network of private and public sector digital copyright exchanges, rights registries and other copyright-related databases, using agreed cross-sectoral and cross-border data building blocks and standards, based on voluntary, opt-in, non-exclusive and pro-competitive principles. \n\nThe Copyright Hub will serve in the UK and beyond a wide range of copyright licensors (rights holders, creators and rights owners in both commercial and cultural worlds) on the supply side and a wide range of copyright licensees/users on the demand side.\n\n"If the industry and public authorities follow the recommendations in this report, we believe that this will put the UK in a leadership position in relation to innovative solutions for copyright licensing."\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

We are supporting two main database projects which will also act as exemplars of what good looks like: the Global Repertoire Database in music publishing where Performing Rights Society (PRS for Music) has been a prime motivator and the Global Recording Database with a similar role played by Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL). The aspiration is for collecting societies around the world to be able to draw on one authoritative database which is kept updated (a key requirement for rights databases), replacing multiple databases where the data conflicts and is not kept up to date.\n\n* We are supporting the Linked Content Coalition (LCC), an international project that emanated from the European Publishers Council, but is now moving into new sectors beyond publishing. The LCC is all about developing a common language and a set of communications standards so proper interoperability is achieved, a very real and necessary building block for the Copyright Hub and its associated databases and DCEs.\n\n*We recommend that: The organisations engaged in licensing content to schools and colleges should offer these licences for sale through an intermediary or aggregator thus in effect creating a ‘one stop shop’ for licensing for educational institutions. This will reduce the number of individual organisations that educational institutions have to deal with to obtain licences (currently around twelve) and should reduce the transaction costs involved in this process.\n\n* We recommend: That the music industry continues to find ways to make the licensing of new digital services over the fixed and mobile internet easier, more automated where appropriate and more accessible. This is and will be done by new types of blanket licensing, by direct licensing and by combinations of blanket and direct licensing. The challenge of direct licensing is to keep the number of different organisations a licensee has to deal with to a sensible minimum. Aggregators and intermediaries play and will play an important role in meeting this challenge.\n\n* That the UK music industry working with the appropriate European organisations continues to pioneer easier ways of licensing across the single European market reducing the number of licensors wherever possible that prospective licensees have to deal with, thus helping to create a true single market across Europe for music.\n\n* We support the ARROW7 and ARROW Plus projects which demonstrate how due diligence in relation to orphan works can be done in an automated way by linking and searching libraries around the world. We especially support the possibility of the technology being usable beyond publishing, for example in the images industry where images without metadata quickly become orphan.\n\n* We recommend that the industries, especially the audiovisual industry where repertoire imbalance is the biggest issue, continue to reduce the problem of repertoire imbalance between the digital and physical worlds and thus counteract the perception of the problem.\n|Description of Data=This study makes an  extensive series of policy recommendations based on a two-phase prior study: Phase 1 – the diagnostic phase – concluded that a number of issues existed with copyright licensing which meant that it was not entirely fit for purpose for the digital age: Hooper & Lynch (2012a) Phase 2: Phase 2 – the solutions phase – sought to identify workable solutions to address the problems identified in Phase 1.\n|Data Year=2011-2012\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Unstructured Interview\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data)\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Sound recording and music publishing; Cultural education; Television programmes; Film and motion pictures; Photographic activities;\n|Country=United Kingdom;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=IPO;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=117\n|Level of Aggregation=Responses to calls for evidence,\n|Data Material Year=2012\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=90\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=2011-12\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1971, 'title': 'Hsu and Su (2008)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Source \n|Name of Study=Hsu and Su (2008)\n|Author=Hsu, J.

International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 9(4), 37-55.\n|Abstract=Led by the development and widespread application of digital technology, consumers are able to duplicate as well as distribute digitized music products at almost no cost. Music file sharing has been deemed illegal in many countries and is quite detrimental to record labels around the world. The music industry is looking for a business model that would let it tap into the new mode of file-sharing consumption. Until now music file-sharing behavior has not been systematically analyzed in the literature. This paper presents an analytical framework by looking at music file-sharing behavior from the perspectives of moral judgment, expertise, and social networking, and then presents a conceptual model of sharing through a set of hypotheses. An empirical study based on the model provides in-depth insights into sharing behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications and further research possibilities.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10864415.2003.11044343\n|Reference=Ratchford, Talukdar and Lee (2001); Moreau, Lehmann and Markman (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This Article aims at proposing a model of consumer behavior which accounts for a better understanding of music piracy. The model mainly considers the moral judgment perspective, the expertise perspective, and the social networking perspective, and it investigates their interrelationships with consumers’ intensity of music file sharing. More specifically, this paper shows that:\n\n* The higher the degree to which consumers judge file sharing to be morally right, the more likely they are to have the expertise to share files.\n\n* A higher level of sharing expertise leads to more intense sharing behavior.\n\n* Entrenched knowledge of old modes of music consumption inhibits a consumer from taking advantage of sharing as a social networking opportunity.\n\n* The social networking orientation of file sharing lessens, rather than heightens, the intensity of music file-sharing behavior.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The results indicate that piracy behavioral intention of different groups of users is influenced by different factors in China. Common users' piratical behavior intention is subjected to subjective norm, while that of professional users is affected by perceived behavioral control, and Firm users are mostly influenced by both punishment factors and perceived behavior control. It also finds that the intention of these three groups is influenced by attitude, but does not respond to the price of the legal software, which suggests Chinese users would never care about the price of legal software.

Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy, 2(1).\n|Abstract=Publishers of computer software and music claimed losses of nearly $16 billion to piracy in 1999. Theoretically, however, piracy may raise legitimate demand through positive demand-side externalities, sampling, and sharing. Accordingly, the actual impact of piracy on the legitimate demand is an empirical issue. Addressing this issue in the context of recorded music, we develop and test hypotheses from theoretical models of end-user and re-seller piracy on international panel data for music CDs. Empirically, we find that the demand for music CDs decreased with piracy, suggesting that "theft" outweighed the "positive" effects of piracy. However, the impact of piracy on CD sales was considerably smaller than industry estimates. Further, we estimated that, accounting for both demand losses and price adjustments, the industry lost no more than 6.6% of revenue to piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/series/cea\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=262651\n|Reference=Besen and Kirby (1989); Gopal and Sanders (2000); Gopal and Sanders (1997); Takeyama (1994);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results: \n\n*In theory, piracy may raise the demand for a legitimate information product. If the positive influences were strong enough, they could outweigh the negative effect of piracy due to the theft of customers. \n\n*Our results for music CDs suggest otherwise. The coefficient of the piracy variable was negative and significant. Even if such positive effects did exist, they were more than offset by the harm caused by the loss in sales due to “theft”.\n\n*The data set further allowed the authors to investigate in detail the presence of an indirect network effect, by which higher piracy increases the ownership of CD players, which in turn stimulates the demand for legitimate music CDs. \n\n*The results showed that the demand for legitimate music CDs was indeed positively associated with higher CD player ownership. However, the correlation between the pirated quantity and CD player ownership was quite modest, and not statistically significant. Pirated music did not have a significant complementary effect on the demand for CD players, and hence it might not have contributed to the raising legitimate demand through an indirect network effect.\n\n*The authors estimated that piracy caused legitimate sales to fall by 0.0954 unit per capita. Assuming that prices remained constant, the average revenue lost to piracy would have been 6.6%. This estimate exaggerates the actual revenue loss because it assumes constant prices. It is lower than the revenue loss that we calculated that a monopoly would have suffered.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Data on music CD sales revenue and volume, CD player ownership, national population, and personal disposable income for 1994-98 were acquired from Global Market Information Database (GMID), which is a comprehensive statistical archive compiled by Euromonitor. \n\n*They compared the GMID with International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) music CD data for 1998, the only year for which the IFPI published comprehensive sales and volume information. The two data sets were closely correlated: the correlation coefficients were 0.993 (p < 0.01) for CD sales volume and 0.996 (p < 0.01) for CD sales revenue.\n\n*They obtained data on Purchasing Power Parity and exchange rates from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) Country Data.\n\n*They obtained data on national piracy using the IFPI’s music CD piracy rates.\n\n*Data on music cassette piracy rates and business computer software piracy rates were obtained from the IFPI and Business Software Alliance (BSA)/Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) respectively. \n\n*They acquired the consumer expenditure and unemployment data from the GMID.\n\n*They also compiled the worldwide number of MTV subscribers from various issues of the annual report of VIACOM, the parent company of MTV Networks, and converted the subscriber base into per-capita terms by using the world population, obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n*The data set for music CDs covered 28 countries over the period 1994-98, which constituted a total of 140 observations. The data set could not be extended beyond 1998 because in the following years, the GMID included its estimates of pirated quantities in its calculations of music CD sales volume and revenue. Therefore, accurate data are not available after 1998.\n|Data Year=1994-1998\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=Global Market Information Database; International Federation of the Phonographic Industry; Economist Intelligence Unit; Business Software Alliance; Software and Information Industry Association; Viacom; US Census;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association, Multivariate Statistics, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games); Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=Argentina; Australia; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Colombia; Czech Republic; Finland; France; Greece; Hong Kong; Hungary; India; Indonesia; Ireland; Israel; Japan; Malaysia; Netherland; New Zealand; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Singapore; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States; Venezuela;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=28\n|Level of Aggregation=Country,\n|Data Material Year=1998\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

File sharing is the catch-all term for uploading and downloading. The short-term implications examined include the direct costs and benefits to society at large. In order to determine the long-term impact, we analyse changes in the industry’s business models as well as in cultural diversity and the accessibility of content. The study draws on existing sources of information to describe the structure and operation of the film, games and music industries and discusses the most important changes in their business models.

This number is relatively high, possibly due to the early introduction of  broadband in the country. Music is the most frequently downloaded product.\n\n- Whereas unlicensed downloading is widespread, the percentage of people who buy  music, films and games in the Netherlands (84%) still far exceeds the percentage of file sharers (35 %), with file sharing and buying being not mutually exclusive.\n\n- The respondents in the survey felt that free downloading had a favourable effect on the accessibility and diversity of  music, films and games, file sharers themselves being particularly positive on this count.\n\n- Both file sharers and non-file sharers believed that musicians, actors, game designers, record companies and film and game producers are negatively affected by file sharing.

A better awareness of what is and is not lawful is also important in relation to the acceptance of new business models.

Accurately measuring the extent of the problem remains challenging due to data deficiencies. \n\n* Very strong evidence of myriad choices when consuming content and consumers are confused about what is legal and not legal.\n\n* Very strong evidence that consumer attitudes and behaviours towards property in the online and physical worlds are very different.\n\n* Very strong evidence that "it has never been easier to break the law."\n\n* The evidence relating to whether there are fewer cues guiding behaviour in the online world is inconclusive and contradictory.\n\n* There is strong empirical evidence (with some contradictory exceptions) that, "education isn’t working, yet" with regards to informing consumers about unauthorised downloading.\n\n* There is strong empirical evidence (with some contradictory findings) of a pervasive idea that there is "‘no victim’, and so ‘no crime"\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

It is changing very basic assumptions about the idea of ownership, sharing, and copying content. New business models are needed, and serious questions are raised about the quality and breadth of content material that will be created without new thinking."\n\n"...even if unauthorised downloading behaviour is changed in this country it is not yet clear that this is possible on a global scale."\n\n"Expectations have been established for the consumer that include fast access to free information, the ability to copy and share such data, and the ability to consume this on a variety of platforms and devices."\n\n"There is a triangle of digital responsibility: between those that create and distribute content, those that consume, share and copy it, and those who manufacture the products that enable these exchanges. To date research and legal action has focused on the consumer – but not on the responsibilities of industry. Ethical reciprocity is not yet clearly defined."\n\n"The Consumer Electronics industry is copyright-dependent, yet is predicated increasingly on technologies that allow the infringement of these copyrights. Hardware and software applications will only become more efficient at these and many other communication processes."\n\n"Web access, like the products of the computer and software businesses, is also going to get better. As it does so more consumers will have the ability to download vast amounts of material, legally or not. Digital literacy education for all ages must include simple information on the complexities of downloading culture. Downloading and sharing per se is not wrong."\n\n"The Internet is built on a paradox of privacy. Surveillance is easy and, as well as posting and sharing their own and others’ content, consumers are revealing their interests to third-parties such as advertisers all the time simply by being online. ISPs are the part of the Internet Triangle that knows what consumers do online, yet they – for obvious and understandable reasons – do not want to become the Internet"\nPolice.\n|Description of Data=The research was conducted by means of:\n\n* A comprehensive and systematic review of the internationally published research literature, which filtered and rated research by its validity and robustness;\n\n* Selected interviews with major stakeholders, regulatory bodies and industry experts;\n\n* An in-depth media analysis which provided the essential currency and identified future trends;\n\n* An empirical exploration of the phenomenon of online downloading, sharing and the re-using of content: we went online and found out just how easy it is to file-share on the Internet – in a multitude of ways.\n\nMore than four hundred reports and papers were identified and evaluated from the thousands published for the quality of their data – full bibliographic references may be found at the end of this report. \n\nIn addition, eight people were interviewed, and media analysis took place over the period January to April 2009.\n|Data Year=2009\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Office of National Statistics; Torrentfreak;\n|Method of Collection=Semi-Structured Interview\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data)\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=UK;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=Yes\n|Funded By=SABIP;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=8\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=2009\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=400\n|Level of Aggregation=Texts,\n|Data Material Year=2009\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2043, 'title': 'Husted (2000)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Husted (2000)\n|Author=Husted, W.

Collectivist nations place a greater emphasis on social harmony than confrontation, on shame than guilt, and on face than truth. The relationship of individualism to software piracy suggests that anti-piracy campaigns need to demonstrate that piracy is a shameful practice that brings a loss of face upon the family, school or business firm. A focus on the criminal nature of piracy would probably have less impact. Economic solutions should provide incentives so that the whole group, rather than the individual, is willing to comply with legal norms. In addition, the software industry needs to understand that collectivist countries, such as India, place less emphasis on individual rights as opposed to overall social well being. For the software business to convince governments of collectivist countries, it must demonstrate that strict regulation of software piracy would lead to greater overall well being for society.\n|Description of Data=Data was obtained entirely from archival sources.

While some broadcasters – especially those in developing economies - still utilise traditional analogue transmission techniques, most have transitioned to more efficient and powerful digital means of sending their programming to viewers. Use of digital technologies has enabled explosive growth in the number of channels and choices of programmes offered. It has also ceded more control to the viewer, allowing on-demand access to programming – not only from broadcasters and pay TV service providers, but also increasingly from online video services delivered over the open Internet. Indeed, as this report outlines, the definitional boundaries between broadcasting and other forms of digital video delivery are increasingly blurred. \n\nThe viewer is undoubtedly a winner as a result of these developments as we move ever closer to the ultimate provision of ubiquitous choice, convenience and control. And broadcasters are usually winners too as evidenced by the impressive global TV market growth described in this report. Inevitably, that growth and technological development is not evenly distributed geographically, and we outline some of the key regional trends in the pages that follow, as well as some more focused snapshots of the market evolution within selected countries.\n\nHowever, this report also highlights a paradox at the heart of this technological revolution; namely, that the ceding of ever more control to the viewer also inevitably means an increasing risk that broadcasters lose control of their programming. It becomes harder and harder to prevent unauthorised access to the copyrighted content that traverses the globe at lightning speeds as digital ‘bits’. This poses an ever greater threat to the economics of intellectual property that sustain the broadcast and related industries.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_30/sccr_30_5.pdf\n|Link=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_30/sccr_30_5.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Television has been transformed by the emergence of digital technologies and the internet. However, while the online TV sector has been growing since 2009, traditional pay TV still accounts for the majority of TV revenues. Television has remained similarly resilient in the advertising market, where it maintains the highest share of advertising revenue across all media. \n\n* Online video is currently growing complementarily to TV advertising, but some cannibalization is starting to be observed in the European Nordic region. Television and video delivery platforms are becoming increasingly complex as viewing preferences move towards a world in which content is available on-demand and in a device agnostic manner. The move to digital from analogue delivery methods has been a key trend among traditional television platforms, since digitisation offers less constraint on the number of channels available to viewers. \n\n* The development of the internet has also seen the growth of online video platforms, which has given rise to changing behaviours of viewers around the world, as well as new competitors to traditional TV players. \n\n* Mobile video consumption is growing rapidly, driven by the growth in smartphone adoption and advanced 4G mobile data networks. However, direct monetisation of mobile video is challenging, with users opting for free services or video delivered as part of a wider premium pay TV or online video subscription, for which there is no additional fee for mobile access.\n\n* The digitisation of all content has unified delivery platforms, meaning that future technologies a more fluent interchange between different platforms. For example, a satellite TV image can interface with internet content delivered over mobile. This places pressure on video distribution to move towards higher quality video. The cost of this has two aspects: the availability of a network or spectrum to deliver, and the technologies needed to improve the efficiency of delivery over a given network.\n\n* For broadcasters, a drawback of the increasing prevalence of digital technologies and changing viewing behaviour is that the ease of obtaining unauthorised access to copyrighted content has increased. As a result of this, various types of piracy have arisen, which bring with them the risk of broadcasters losing control of their programming, as well as threatening the economics of intellectual property. The impact of shifting audiences on global TV and advertising revenues will largely depend on the legacy structures of each country’s TV and wider media ecosystems.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Deviant Behavior, 29(4), 334-366.\n|Abstract=The current study sought to test the viability of employing Sykes and Matza’s (1957) techniques of neutralization as a framework for understanding online music piracy. Using data from a sample of 2,032 undergraduates from a large Midwestern university, the relevance of neutralization theory is tested via multinomial logistic regression while controlling for other theoretical predictors and demographic variables. The findings indicated that greater acceptance of the techniques associated with denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, and appeal to higher loyalties significantly predicted moderate levels of piracy participation. Furthermore, the effect of appeals to higher loyalty on piracy was found to be conditioned by the respondent’s approval of the behavior. Overall, results suggested that university settings may unwittingly facilitate a climate for online piracy whereby students place a higher value on group norms rather than legal norms and do not consider the harms associated with the behavior.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639620701588131\n|Reference=Sykes and Matza (1957); Chiou, Huang and Lee (2005); D'Astous, Colbert and Montpetit (2005); Hinduja (2006); Hinduja and Ingram (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article aims at assessing neutralization theory’s applicability to online music piracy to determine its empirical validity. It seeks to test the relevance of neutralization techniques to music pirating behavior and examines the proposed nonlinear relationship between acceptance of the techniques and the level of participation in music piracy. It shows that: \n\n* The neutralization techniques were weakly related to piracy, with greater acceptance of the techniques being associated with higher participation levels.       \n\n* The relationship between this specific neutralization and music piracy appears to be conditioned by students’ beliefs regarding unauthorized downloading.\n\n* Students who disapproved of unauthorized music downloading were significantly more likely to be influenced by the neutralization measure of higher loyalty.\n\n* Disapproving students with low levels of involvement in music piracy were also significantly more likely to invoke the technique of condemnation compared to those in the no participation category.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

M. Almost Wikipedia: Eight Early Encyclopedia Projects and the Mechanisms of Collective Action.''' [http://mako.cc/academic/hill-almost_wikipedia-DRAFT.pdf]\n\n\n''Abstract'': Before Wikipedia was created in January 2001, there were seven attempts to create English-language online collaborative encyclopedia projects. Several of these attempts built sus- tainable communities of volunteer contributors but none achieved anything near Wikipedia’s success. Why did Wikipedia, superficially similar and a relatively late entrant, attract a commu- nity of millions and build the largest and most comprehensive compendium of human knowl- edge in history? Using data from interviews of these Wikipedia-like projects’ initiators and extensive archival data, I suggest three propositions for why Wikipedia succeeded in mobilizing volunteers where these other projects failed. I also present disconfirming evidence for two im- portant alternative explanations. Synthesizing these results, I suggest that Wikipedia succeeded because its stated goal hewed closely to a widely shared concept of “encyclopedia” familiar to many potential contributors, while innovating around the process and the social organization of production.\n\n\n== Propositions ==\n\n- Wikipedia attracted contributors because it was built around a familiar product.\n\n- Wikipedia attracted contributors because it offered low barriers to contribution.\n\n- Wikipedia attracted contributors because it offered low attribution and low social\nownership of content.\n\n== Method ==\n \n- Multiple [[case study]] Analysis, [[interviews]], digital content analysis\n\n== Discipline ==\n \n- [[Sociology]]\n\n== Data ==\n\n- Interviews and historical records on 8 failed wikipedia projects (founders and users) to interrogate incentives for participation\n\n== Interventions-Response ==\n\n- Welfare can be promoted by flexible legal frameworks that allow the combination of product familiarity and innovative structures of organisation."}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2308, 'title': 'International treaty', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': ''}], 'ns': 0}]}

S., Heuvelman, A., Tan, M. & Peters, O. (2012). Digital movie piracy: A perspective on downloading behavior through social cognitive theory. Computers in Human Behavior, 28(3), 958-967.\n|Abstract=The current article attempts to refine and specify a model based on other researchers' applications of the Social Cognitive Theory originally posited by Bandura to allow the behaviour and attitudes downloaders exhibit to be analysed and compared to the amount of movies they consume (measured as an monthly average estimate). The new model is then tested against data obtained from college students as well as from a technological lifestyle forum. After the revisions these analyses suggested were applied, the model explained nearly 23% of the variance in the number of movies downloaded. The most important factors in this model were, among others: the drives to see many different and new movies, the social environment and its perceived attitude toward the behaviour, and the degree to which downloading has embedded itself in the daily routine. Because the Dutch government and lobbyists are superficially unclear about the current legislature, the unique opportunity existed to study the impact of knowing about legislature on the behaviour. Other results indicate an unexpected openness to an alternative film-distribution method where both the producers and the consumers get an honest deal, presenting options to release the current political and social tension without prosecuting an increasing portion of the population.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211002913\n|Link=http://essay.utwente.nl/59875/1/BSc_R_Jacobs.pdf\n|Reference=Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004); La Rose and Kim (2007); Peters (2007); Taylor, Ishida and Wallace (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- While downloading as a whole is an established activity, its particulars (like the knowledge state and economic interest) are still in constant shift, leading to both a habituation to downloading and an awareness of the expectations.\n\n- The current generation does not harbour a great amount of moral qualms about downloading movies. Added to this are the data which show that variance in the items from moral justification do not correlate significantly with changes in the number of downloads.\n\n- Knowledge of laws is a valued component of expected outcomes, but any direct effect on them is questionable.\n\n- Self-efficacy doesn't play a major role in predicting downloading behaviour. A possible reason for this is that downloading movies might not require a great amount of skill; navigating the web and exploring its possibilities is getting progressively less complex.\n\n- As self-efficacy and moral justification influences fade, for an increasing amount of consumers downloading becomes second nature, and an activity that for many seems like a criminal pursuit does not occupy much conscious thought in the minds of downloaders.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

In all probability, efforts to reduce downloading movies without paying distributors need to start there. Another method of reducing the tension surrounding downloading movies is to take an in-depth look at what the problem is. While it is outside of the scope of this article to imply there is not an issue, other investigations into profit reductions of media sales have not always correlated these faltering sales with the rise in downloading activity (Oberholzer & Strumpf, 2004). Similarly, the findings in the current study suggest that simply demonizing the downloading community might not be an effective strategy for stakeholders and governments.\n|Description of Data=The questionnaire created by the authors was started a total of 436 times.

College students' moral evaluations of illegal music downloading. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 33, 31-39.\n|Abstract=Although unauthorised music downloading is illegal, a majority of college students have downloaded music for free online. Evaluations of illegal music downloading and their association with downloading behaviour were examined using social domain theory in a sample of 188 ethnically diverse college students (M.age = 19.80 years, SD = 1.36, 56% female). All students treated prototypical moral events as moral on a domain classification task. Students treated illegal downloading as a complex moral issue and, less frequently, as a personal issue (but rarely as a conventional issue of law or authority); judgments varied when different concerns regarding the fair price of music and the structure of the music industry were made salient. Greater discrepancies between the actual price of music and what students viewed to be fair were associated with past illegal downloading, while a greater focus on downloading as stealing was associated with abstaining from downloading.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0193397311001146\n|Reference=Gerlich (2005); Gopal Sanders, Bhattacharjee, Agrawal, Wagner (2004); Levin, Dato-on, Manolis (2007); Levin, Dato-on, Rhee (2004); Plowman, Goode (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results reported by this study:\n\n*Students treat illegal downloading as a complex issue entailing conflicts between competing claims. Manipulations in information about the nature of the music industry and the price of music were systematically associated with variations in judgments, and moral beliefs were uniquely associated with past illegal downloading over and above the extent to which individuals viewed music as important in their lives. \n\n*The ability to distinguish between prototypical moral, conventional, personal, and prudential events did not differ between students who had and had not illegally downloaded, casting doubt on the claim that youth who engage in illegal music downloading are more ethically and morally deficient. \n\n*The results of the study suggest that individuals are concerned with balancing the need to pay for music with their own rights as consumers. As reflected in their fair price ratings, the vast majority of participants thought that the current price of music was unfairly high. This was mirrored in their acceptability judgments as well: illegal downloading was judged significantly more wrong when cost was removed as a concern. Rather than reflecting purely pragmatic or economic concerns, these responses also revealed a decidedly moral orientation. \n\n*Nearly all participants (95%) believed that music should cost at least something: challenging the common perception that youth today do not believe in having to pay for music.\n\n*Longitudinal research would be useful to determine how involvement in illegal downloading influences one's interpretations of the act over time.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Young college students do have intact moral judgment abilities, and they do care about the morality of downloading. However, the rights of the consumers and artists, and not the record companies, seem to be of most concern.\n|Description of Data=Online survey in four parts, distributed to 188 US college students (M.age = 19.80 years).\n|Data Year=Not stated\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Data Source=None;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=United States;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None;\n|Level of Aggregation=University students;\n|Data Material Year=2011\n|Sample Size=188\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=188\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=Not stated\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1572, 'title': 'J: Labor and Demographic Economics', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Discipline}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

This paper addresses this question empirically using a unique firm-level data set from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It finds that weak protection deters foreign investors in technology-intensive sectors that rely heavily on intellectual property rights. Moreover, the results indicate that a weak intellectual property regime encourages investors to undertake projects focusing on distribution rather than local production.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001429210200257X\n|Reference=Mansfield (1995); Ginarte and Park (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The paper tested two hypothesis:\n\n# FDI in sectors relying heavily on protection of intellectual property is likely to be deterred by a weak IPR regime, not necessarily true for FDI inflows in general.\n# In countries with weak protection of intellectual property, investors may be more inclined to engage solely in distribution activities rather than in local production.\n\nResults:\n* Regarding the first hypothesis, the data indicates that investors in sectors relying heavily on protection of intellectual property are deterred by a weak IPR regime in a potential host country. There is also some evidence that weak\nIPR protection may discourage all investors, not just those in the sensitive sectors.\n\n* Regarding the second hypothesis, the lack of IPR protection deters investors from undertaking local production and encourages them to focus on distribution of imported products. Interestingly, this effect is present in all sectors, not only those relying heavily on IPR protection\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The economics of copying. Journal of Political Economy 93.1 (1985): 158-174.\n|Abstract=Recent technological advances that enable consumers to copy creative works without compensating their owners have led to proposals for restrictions on copying. To analyze such restrictions, this paper considers two models of copying. The first model emphasizes the household production aspect of copying with costs differing across consumers, while the second relies on the fixed cost of copying technologies.\nIn both models, a case can be made for restricting copying even in the short run if copying induces a large reduction in demand for originals relative to its effect on total consumption. The long-run case for restriction hinges additionally on the elasticity of supply and the value consumers place on product variety.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1830506\n|Reference=Novos and Waldman (1984); Ordover and Willig (1978);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Using two plausible models of copying, this paper has advanced the possibilities that unlimited copying reduces social welfare and that restrictions on copying may enhance social surplus.

Oxford Economic Papers, 235-264.\n|Abstract=Of the diverse factors motivating technological change, one factor that has received increasing attention in the recent past has been the protection of intellectual property rights. Given fairly recent changes in the international policy ethos where a regime of stronger intellectual property protection has become a fait accompli for most developing countries (and the developed too), it is of some significance to ask whether more stringent protection of intellectual property does indeed encourage innovation. And this is the question which this paper examines, utilising cross‐country panel data on R&D investment, patent protection and other country‐specific characteristics spanning the period 1981–95. The evidence unambiguously indicates the significance of intellectual property rights as incentives for spurring innovation.\n|Authentic Link=http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/235.abstract\n|Link=https://ideas.repec.org/p/egc/wpaper/831.html\n|Reference=Evenson (1990); Lanjouw and Cockburn (2001); Lerner (1994); Gould and Gruben (1996); Park and Ginarte (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Evidence was found to support the claim that protection of intellectual property rights encourages technological change insofar as intellectual property protection was found to have a strong positive investment on R&D investment.\n\n* There appeared to be some basis for the claim that relationship between R&D and protection may not be backward-bending\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

(2010). Analysis of the key reasons behind the pirated software usage of Turkish Internet users: Application of routine activities theory (Doctoral dissertation, University of Baltimore).\n|Abstract=The basic reason for protection of intellectual property rights is the necessity to encourage and support innovation and to promote the creation of knowledge. Intellectual property has a functional effect on the creation, development and innovation of the intellectual products which improve our life. Software piracy is one of the important parts of the digital piracy problem, and according to Swinward et al. (1990), software was also the first copyrighted product that was duplicated on a large scale. BSA defined software piracy as the illegal copying, downloading, sharing, selling or installing of copyrighted software.\nIt is difficult to measure accurately the worldwide magnitude of the software piracy problem. According to the Business Software Alliance (BSA) Global Software Piracy Report, the rate of software piracy in 2009 was 43%. This is a serious problem for the world economy, but the problem is more serious in Turkey. According to the BSA 2009 Global Software Piracy Report, the software piracy rate in Turkey was 63% in 2009. If the assumption is made that every instance of pirated software usage equals an amount of loss in the economy, then the impact of the loss on the Turkish economy was 415 million dollars. Before advanced technology and high speed Internet, software piracy was carried out by copying disks or other types of physical objects, but now almost all types of software piracy occur over the Internet.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the factors that contribute to pirated software usage among Turkish Internet users in order to define the dynamics behind the problem of software piracy from the Internet users’ perspective. Definition of the reasons behind an existing problem is a crucial part of the problem solving process. With this study the factors behind the problem of pirated software usage will be empirically analyzed from the users’ perspective by applying Routine Activity Theory. According to RAT, three major factors that affect criminal activities include access to suitable targets, motivated offenders and the absence of capable guardians. According to the routine activity approach, crime or the risk of crime increases when a motivated offender identifies or encounters a suitable target in the absence of a capable guardian.\n|Authentic Link=http://gradworks.umi.com/34/13/3413636.html\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2555, 'title': 'Karaganis and Urban (2015)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Karaganis and Urban (2015)\n|Author=Karaganis, J; Urban, J;\n|Title=The rise of the robo notice\n|Year=2015\n|Full Citation=Karaganis, J., & Urban, J. (2015). The rise of the robo notice. Communications of the ACM, 58(9), 28-30.\n|Abstract=The great virtue of the notice and takedown process for online services is its proceduralism. To take the most common example, if a service reliant on user-generated content follows the statutory procedures, acts on notices, and otherwise lacks specific knowledge of user infringement on its site (the complicated "red flag" knowledge standard), it can claim safe harbor protection in the event of a lawsuit. Services can make decisions about taking down material based on substantive review and their tolerance for risk. They may also adopt technologies or practices to supplement notice and takedown, though the law makes no such demands beyond a requirement for repeat infringer policies. The resulting balance has enabled a relatively broad scope for innovation in search and user-generated-content services. As one entrepreneur put it in our recent study of these issues, notice and takedown was "written into the DNA" of the Internet sector. The rights holder companies are slowly winning on enforcement and the largest Internet companies have become powerful enough to fend off changes in law that could threaten their core business models.\n|Authentic Link=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191182-the-rise-of-the-robo-notice/abstract\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In the last five or six years, the practice of notice and takedown has changed dramatically, driven by the adoption of automated notice-sending systems by rights holder groups responding to sophisticated infringing sites.\n\n* For some online services, the numbers of complaints went from dozens or hundreds per year to hundreds of thousands or millions. In 2009, Google’s search service received less than 100 takedown requests. In 2014, it received 345 million requests.\n\n* As automated notices overwhelmed small legal teams, targeted services lost the ability to fully vet the complaints they received. Because companies exposed themselves to high statutory penalties if they ignored valid complaints, the safest path afforded by the DMCA was to remove all targeted material. Some companies did so. Some responded by developing automated triage procedures that prioritized high-risk notices for human review (most commonly, those sent by individuals).\n\n* The DMCA+ measures included the use of content filtering systems, such as YouTube’s ContentID and Audible Magic. They included special takedown privileges for trusted senders; expanded profiling of users; restrictive terms of service; modifications to search functionality; and other approaches that stretched beyond the DMCA’s requirements.\n\n* Smaller services sometimes ceded control of takedown to rights holder groups, in some cases via direct back-end administrative access. Larger services with more leverage sought to retain control but, in some cases, adopted blocking or content filtering systems as part of their risk assessments.\n\n* Today, for online services with significant copyright exposure, the DMCA’s procedural balance is, practically speaking, obsolete. Practices shift the balance of protection from users to rights holders, and hold out the statutory remedies as, at best, last resorts for user and services\n\n* According to smaller services surveyed, traditional DMCA compliance appears fragile—dependent on rights holder forbearance or inattention that could change at any time.\n\n* Google takes down 97.5% of requests. This percentage proved, in our surveys, to be on the low end for companies that receive large numbers of automated notices.\n\n* 1 in 25 (4.2%) of the requests sampled were fundamentally flawed—simply targeting the wrong content\n\n* One-third of requests (28.9%) had characteristics that raised concerns about the validity of the claim\n\n* Despite the resources Google invests in this process, almost none of these notices, statistically speaking, receive substantive examination.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

In this article, we trace the origins of this provision to a conceptual shift that took place during the early 1800s. Specific regulations of the book trade were superseded by the protection of all instantiations (such as performances, translations and adaptations) of abstract authored work. For two seminal copyright acts of the period, the Prussian Act of 1837 and the UK Act of 1842, we show there was considerable concern about the economic implications of this new justificatory paradigm, reflected in a period of experimentation with sophisticated registration requirements. We indicate market responses to these requirements and plea for a reconsideration of “formalities” as redressing justificatory problems of copyright in the digital environment.\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/1267/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2619272\n|Reference=Reichman (1994); Samuelson et al (1994); Sherman and Bently (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=After re-assessing the economic rationale for the registration requirement, registration is suggested as a policy option in the context of contemporary copyright laws under pressure from digitization.\nWe have identified some sophisticated registration systems pioneered in theearly 19th century context when a dramatic conceptual shift took place away from specific regulations of printing towards a broad protection of abstract works. Pace Berne, these registration mechanisms should be subjected to a more far-reaching welfare analysis. Digital technology may not only facilitate copying, but also allow the creation and maintenance of databases defining modes of exploitation and rights claimed. Some of the energies of the entertainment industry’s anti-piracy campaign may be fruitfully channelled into such an enterprise. \nIt may not be realistic to expect an imminent review of the international copyright regime following the integration of key parts of Berne into the TRIPS agreement of 1994 (now administered by the WTO). However, copyright enforcement in the digital environment depends on a certain level of normative consensus among its users. This could be achieved by a system of voluntary registration, specifying intended exploitation, with the aim to encourage unpredicted creative re-use of cultural materials.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Nature and Scope of exclusive rights (hyperlinking/browsing; reproduction right),\n|Discipline=K: Law and Economics, K0: General\n|Intervention-Response=Registration was part of many early copyright institutional mechanisms, initially as a permission to publish. As an economic burden, however, it was not very onerous. It involved a decision over which works warranted protection (creating some opportunity costs) and modest fees to the registrar.30 In imposing opportunity and administration costs, registration increases the public domain to all works which creators or publishers do not consider valuable enough to offset these costs. Broadly speaking, any registration requirement reduces the number of works in copyright - by how much depends on the precise structure of the system. From the patent system, we may glean that there are at least two further ways of increasing the public domain effects of registration: increasing annual fees, and claims that specify the precise nature of the rights granted.\nFrom a public policy perspective, this trade off is welcome. Protection is only granted to exploitations that are commercially valuable (and might not have occurred without protection), while future authors can make free and creative use of a larger number of cultural materials. This tallies with a widely accepted economic and political premise that access to information is central to innovation and the fabric of open societies.\n|Data Year=1820-1850\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Qualitative content/text mining\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Analysis Methods, Textual Content Analysis\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Software publishing (including video games); Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Data Material Year=1820 - 1850\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1957, 'title': 'Khan (2004)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Khan (2004)\n|Author=Khan, B.

I examine the effects of U.S. copyright piracy during a period when the U.S. was itself a developing country. U.S. statutes since 1790 protected the copyrights of American citizens, but until 1891 deemed the works of foreign citizens to be in the public domain. In 1891, the laws were changed to allow foreigners to obtain copyright protection in the United States if certain conditions were met. Thus, this episode in American history provides us with a convenient way of investigating the consequences of international copyright piracy. My analysis is based on copyright registrations, information on authors, book titles and prices, financial data from the accounts of a major publishing company, and lawsuits regarding copyright questions. These data are used to investigate the welfare effects of widespread infringement of foreign works on American publishers, writers, and the public. The results suggest that the United States benefited from piracy and that the choice of copyright regime was endogenous to the level of economic development.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10271\n|Link=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10271.pdf\n|Reference=Li, MacGarvie, Moser (2014)\n|Plain Text Proposition=- The evidence from the regressions does not support the notion that American books were suffering from competition with cheaper foreign books.\n\n- Only for some classes of publications the majority of books in the US were written by Americans.\n\n- There is a gradual decline over time in the role of foreign authorship, between 1790 and 1829, two thirds of all authors of fiction bestsellers were foreign, a discrete change in relative success of American writers occurred after the 1830s.

Seven variables, including income level, income inequality, individualism– collectivism, level of education, intellectual property protection, music CD price, and music market size, were adopted for this study.

This may imply that people with higher education may have greater moral and ethical standards against music piracy.\n\n- In the current study, unlike earlier research that suggested that individualism–collectivism was an influential factor onmusic piracy rates, such effect on music piracy was not supported.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Music companies can promote the advantages of buying an original music CD by investing more money in the music market. This may be employed as an initial strategy to encourage the market to maturate in a country where levels of music piracy are relatively high.\nTo reduce illegal copying, buying, and selling of music Cds in the long term, an expansion of the music market can be more effective than lawsuits against consumers or developing technology to prevent unauthorized duplication.\n|Description of Data=The data pertaining to music piracy rates across countries used in this study were provided by the IFPI.

CC licenses are used to build reputation and used to market commercially valuable works.\n* “Build your own IP” allowed by CC was always available through individual contracts and licenses under copyright.

Leonardo Electronic Almanac, 19(4).\n|Abstract=What is the role of copyright in the everyday social context of new, emerg¬ing and ‘born digital’ artistic activities? Is copyright able to govern the practical behaviour of artists and creative practitioners? If not, then what or who impacts on their behaviour? This paper focuses on the interac¬tion of copyright with the everyday life of creators working in the digital environment and discusses their ‘schizophrenic’ position. It draws upon a qualitative empirical study with digital artists aimed at exploring their perceptions of copyright law: how they understand and manage copyright and how copyright interacts with the local circumstances of their day to day creative practice. A finding of this study was that some of the artists faced moral dilemmas and were pulled in different directions with respect to their perspectives and decisions regarding copyright. The consequence of this was a seemingly ‘schizophrenic’ position, one that manifested in various ways – such as emphasize that ‘copying’ cannot and should not be controlled in the digital medium but equally feeling compelled to have some control. Other artists rejected the prevention of copying in the digital domain while relying on exclusivity of copies in the analogue domain and / or denied the applicability of traditional notions of authorship to their practice while asserting the importance of attribution.\n|Link=http://ojs.gold.ac.uk/index.php/lea/article/view/52\n|Reference=Geist (2006); Party (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Copyright law was not seen to have any independent ability to incentivize or indeed govern the interviewees’ practice as an external influence. Instead, a range of ‘actors’ were found to contribute to decision-making and norm-setting in the interviewees’ practices being regulated with little recourse to formal rules of copyright.\n* While ‘copyright protection’ was one of such actors that could play a part in informing creators in their decisions on creation, dissemination and exploitation of their works, various other ‘actors’ were found to play a much more prominent role. Some of these ‘actors’ were: their attraction to the potentials and inherent capabilities of the digital medium, their understandings and meanings of the ‘digital,’ their political and ethical stance, contemporary art practices and philosophy, their academic and research backgrounds, strong intrinsic motivations, lack of knowledge of the law as well as their legal consciousness.\n* Strong intrinsic motivations also played an important role in shaping their practice. The interviewees communicated that the motivation behind their creative practice was not financial gain and emphasis was placed upon the belief that it was certainly not a precondition for them to have and continue their art practice. Instead, they believed that their personal motivations of simply wanting to be involved in, and remain involved in, the creative process (for reasons such personal interest, enjoyment, ‘a compulsion to create’) was the driving force behind their practice.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

However, entertainment/pass time, convenience/economic utility and information-seeking factors and experience were predictors of building a library of music on one’s computer.

Specifically, software piracy is becoming economically devastating to companies that develop and market software. Some researchers have argued that the level of moral intensity regarding software piracy of individuals may be related to the extent of actual software piracy behaviour. In order to empirically study this relationship, it is important to understand the concept of moral intensity towards software piracy. In this research, we study the concept in an international setting, a university in Thailand. We report the relationship between moral intensity and some important demographic variables and also explore the relationship between moral intensity of individuals and the perceived moral intensity of their community, the students, employees, and faculty.

To determine which economic, legal, and social factors cause the considerable differences in piracy of U.S. copyright industries’ products in individual countries, we tested 4 industry models.We found that for most industries piracy can be explained by the risk profile of the country involved (signaling economic and political stability and growth potential) and the existence of a strong intellectual property rights system. Furthermore, for the 4 analyzed copyright-based industries, considerable variation in piracy\nexists between geographic regions. This study shows that disaggregation of the copyright piracy data by industry is helpful in analyzing and understanding piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327736me1802_3\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227620900_Multimedia_Entertainment_and_Business_Software_Copyright_Piracy_A_Cross-National_Study ; http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327736me1802_3 ; http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/unmumamet/2003039.htm\n|Reference=Ginarte and Park (1997); Marron and Steel (2000); Silva and Ramello (2000); Takeyama (1997); Shy and Thisse (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*Large market size of a host country results in higher revenue losses for the creative industries, even if the piracy rates in these industries are relatively low.\n\n*In general, low-risk countries show lower piracy rates and that the revenue losses suffered by U.S. companies producing and selling copyright-related products in these countries are positively related with the risk, with one exception: revenue losses due to business software applications piracy. \n\n*The evidence shows significant differences in piracy among separate regions in the world.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Computer science students are the future information and communication technologies professionals and it is important to study the way they approach this issue. In this article, we attempt to study attitudes, behaviours and the corresponding reasoning of computer science students in Greece regarding software piracy. The statements taken in 56 semi-structured interviews with students indicate that computer science students in Greece make intensive use of pirated software, mention as main reason for their practice the cost of genuine software, and blame the academic environment, coincidental stereotypes and their student status for this behaviour. They acknowledge the immoral character of their actions, as well as the fact that others are affected by software piracy, but they pay little attention to this action and they practically don’t care. While keeping distance from software development companies, when specifically asked, they easily adopt the role of a software developer and attempt to substantiate their current and eventually future attitude out of hand. They consider software copyright laws to be inapplicable and unrealistic and fail to argue against intellectual property rights for mere digital products, such as software.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290902765076\n|Reference=Lau (2003); Limayem, Khalifa and Chin (2004); Al-Rafee and Cronan (2006); Cronan, Foltz and Jones (2006); Kini, Ramakrishna and Vijayaraman (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article aims at recording the attitudes, behaviours and moral reasoning of computer science students towards software intellectual property rights. This analysis of student arguments contributes to the designing of instructional initiatives aiming to raise awareness against software piracy. It shows that:\n\n* All computer science students participating in the research are using pirated software. The students admit that they began to use pirated software when they started using their computer, independently of their studies.\n\n* The vast majority replied that at first they hadn’t even thought about software intellectual rights while using pirated software, because using such software was the prevalent social practice.\n\n* Students do not show any remorse for using pirated software and their statements confirm the low moral intensity of software piracy.\n\n* Students rationalise the continuous use of pirated software, claiming that they can not ‘bear’ the cost of genuine software. The majority of students consider genuine software as overpriced for home users or for themselves.\n\n* The majority of students are not aware of intellectual property laws, whereas those who have knowledge of them admit that their knowledge is limited.\n\n* Computer science students do not demonstrate a strong interest in analysing their prospective professional life or in developing professional conduct in regard to software piracy.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

In particular, it is widely assumed that exploiters insist on "grabbing rights" (i.e. broadly conceived assignments of rights), that visual artists are not able to negotiate, that they are paid less and less, and that they are compelled to waive their moral rights.\nThis study suggests a much more equivocal picture. In place of a straightforward narrative of decline, the results of the survey suggest that in most fields there has been less change over the last decade than one might have expected: that, terms of exploitation are most often about the same. That is not to say that there are no discernible changes in particular occupations and media. Respondents and interviewees identify some important shifts. Perhaps surprisingly, it seems there are changes in practice that are, from the creator\'s perspective, both positive and negative. The most positive change is identified amongst the fine artists where half (50%) see their personal bargaining position as having improved, with only 6% perceiving a weakening. The most disturbing changes are in relation to photographers. About half of all photographers (49%) say their bargaining position has worsened, with only 22% reporting improvements. A significant percentage of photographers (40%) report an increase in assignments (compared with 6% who think they have decreased). Moreover, 24% report an increase in moral rights waivers (compared to 3% who identify a decrease), and a decline in the practice of attribution. 31% of photographers see attribution as decreasing over the last decade, and only 8% increasing. 28% say income from secondary use has decreased, while only 16% say it has decreased.\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/19521/2/DACS-Report-Final.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1780206\n|Reference=Frey and Pommerehne (1989); Kretschmer and Hardwick (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This study offers a detailed picture of the conditions under which visual creators worked in the UK in 2010, using a survey, supplemented by focus group research and legal analysis.\n\n* Visual artists have precarious careers, with typical earnings well below the UK national median wage of £21,320.

This response by the CREATe Centre attempts to make two contributions: (1) the process of policy formation matters for the evolution of the EU legal framework, and so we offer a short critique of the consultation format; (2) we summarise available evidence in seven thematic areas where CREATe has developed or is developing research (term of protection, libraries and archives, disabilities, text and data mining, user-generated content, fair remuneration for authors and performers, and respect for rights). CREATe understands evidence here as empirically grounded, but open to historical and comparative approaches.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2509186\n|Reference=Favale and Kretschmer, 2012;\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Though most economists and intellectual property scholars contend the term of copyright protection excessive, the recent extension for sound recordings from 50 to 70 years presents an opportunity to investigate whether the extended term does, in fact, support arguments made in favor of the 70-year term. \n\n* Much of the questions in the consultation do not adequately consider the unique issues dealt with by an archive; rather they are focused on copyright rules as they impact the use of and access to library collections. \n* Making optional the disability exception creates the danger of impeding free movement for EU citizens with disabilities. In addition, more attention should be paid to citizens with mental health problems and learning disabilities. \n* A Hargreaves-like exemption should be implemented as part of an EU regulatory instrument, but consideration should also be given to taking text mining entirely out of the copyright arena. \n* Unlawful file sharing evidence is predominantly supported by studies focusing on music files. There is further evidence to suggest that such welfare implications may not apply equally to all types of media, including movies and software and especially videogames, books or TV content.

(2010). A Review commissioned by the UK Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property Policy (SABIP). Available at SSRN 2624945\n|Abstract=Contracts lie at the heart of the regulatory system governing the creation and dissemination of cultural products in two respects: (1) The exclusive rights provided by copyright law only turn into financial reward, and thus incentives to creators, through a contract with a third party to exploit protected material. (2) From a user perspective purchases of protected material may take the form of a licensing contract, governing behaviour after the initial transaction.\nThus, a review of the relationship between copyright and contract law has to address both supply- and demand-side issues. On the supply side, policy concerns include whether copyright law delivers the often stated aim of securing the financial independence of creators. Particularly acute are the complaints by both creators and producers that they fail to benefit from the exponential increase in the availability of copyright materials on the Internet. On the demand side, the issue of copyright exceptions and their policy justification has become central to a number of reviews and consultations dealing with digital content. Are exceptions based on user needs or market failure? Do exceptions require financial compensation? Can exceptions be contracted out by licence agreements?\nThis report (i) reviews economic theory of contracts, value chains and transaction costs, (ii) identifies a comprehensive range of regulatory options relating to creator and user contracts, using an international comparative approach, (iii) surveys the empirical evidence on the effects of regulatory intervention, and (iv) where no evidence is available, extrapolates predicted effects from theory.\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/16091/1/_contractlaw-report.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624945\n|Reference=Caves (2000); Cohen and Burk (2001); Derclaye (2006); Brodie (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In general, the economic theory profession has not considered in any detail the relationship between the legal institution of copyright and the types of contracts that are written along the value chain for copyright goods. Overall, a more careful, methodological, and above all a more formal application of the well-known principal-agent framework to the specific case of copyright constitutes the most logical first step forward for economists.\n\n* The relationship between copyright and contract law lies at the heart of the regulatory system governing the creation and dissemination of cultural products. Overall, it remains an open question whether there is a negative or positive relationship between the strength of copyright protection and the total earnings of creators.\n\n* The analysis of the legislation, the case law, and the literature of the targeted countries so far reveals a substantial body of literature and case law on the interplay between copyright and contract within the United States. The European Union follows, with substantial legislation and literature, but not much relevant case law.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

As Thomas Babington (Lord) Macaulay argued in a famous speech on copyright reform in the House of Commons (5 February 1841): “…there are only two ways in which (men of letters) can be remunerated. One of those is patronage; the other is copyright.”\nIn a continuous line of reasoning, the thought persisted into the recitals of current European legislation. The 2001 Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) is introduced thus: “If authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive appropriate reward for the use of their work…” (Recital 10). “A rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers” (Recital 11).\nThis study shows quite conclusively that current copyright law has empirically failed to meet these aims. The rewards to best-selling writers are indeed high but as a profession, writing has remained resolutely unprosperous.\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/71475/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2619649\n|Reference=Towse (2001); Kretschmer (2002); Schmitt (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (‘typical’) wage of £12,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of €12,000/£8,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n\n* Compared to the UK, writers’ earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed.\n\n* Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n\n* Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

An Empirical Analysis of Creators’ Earnings (May 21, 2012).\n|Abstract=Copyright matters to creators. The claim has pervaded copyright jurisprudence and economic analysis for over 200 years. Creative production would not take place without the incentive of artificial scarcity that copyright law provides. Authors and artists would starve.\n\nProfessor Breyer (as he then was) wryly remarked in The Uneasy Case (1970, at 324): “It is, of course, conceivable that some prospective Miltons have given up writing after learning that Milton’s daughter was destitute, but it is unlikely.”\n\nThis article surveys what the empirical data actually say about the way creators live. The argument proceeds in three steps.\n\nFirst, the relationship of copyright and contract law is conceptualised, starting from an analysis of contracts concluded in a pre-copyright environment (Milton 1667; Schiller 1791). The extent of statutory dependence is then scrutinised for typical sources of earnings of creators at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nSecond, empirical evidence on creator earnings in developed cultural markets is reviewed. It is shown that the bottom 50% of composers/songwriters earn less than 5% of the total income of the population of composers/songwriters; the bottom 50% of literary authors earn under 10% of total income; the bottom 50% of visual creators earn about 10% of total income. Median incomes are close to the poverty line. The top 10% of creators receive a disproportionally large share (visual creators: 45% of total income; literary authors: 65% of total income; composers/songwriters: 80% of total income).\n\nFinally, possible interpretations of these data in the light of Landes & Posner’s “harmony of interest” assumption (An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, 1989) are considered and rejected. Creators (authors, performers) and investors (publishers, producers) have conflicting interests, and copyright law does not harmonise but exacerbate these.\n\nThe article concludes that copyright law empirically fails to secure the financial independence of creators. If it works as an incentive for some, this may be based on a systematic cognitive mistake.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2063735\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Beyer (1970); Milton (1667); Schiller (1791);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* There were 3 main themes of the paper, firstly the author started by outlining the conceptual relationship between copyright law and contracts by looking at two different types of contracts. One between an author and the publisher and the other between a footballer and the club. The author goes on to make the point that contracts between the author and publisher would exist even without copyright citing the contract between the footballer and the club as an example of that type of contract.\n* Takes a closer look into the utilitarian rationale of copyright, and suggests a shorter term copyright. \n* Secondly the author move on to contrast income of different types of creators with copyright contracts (using data from various different surveys and data sources) with income from all UK employees. The author found that the income from copyright industries was significantly less on average and far more unequal compared to income from all employment and that most artists gained large amounts of income from non-copyright sources like teaching. The author also added that artists’ income was very unstable and more creators try to embark on a career than are able to sustain them.\n* Strong competition for author and lower consumer prices was suggested as a solution to motivate creators.\n* Large number of artists make their money from non-copyright works\n* Author highlights the large gap between what the top creators, in both visual and literary markets, earn compared to the rest, continues to conclude that copyright makes this gap between distributions worse. \n* Lastly the author critiqued the “harmony of interest assumption” outlined by Landes and Posner in 1989. The author concluded that for superstar creators the market works well, they can either choose to shift risk to commercial intermediary and the publisher can also choose to share risk through a royalty contract or absorb it using a buyout. This however is not true with non-bestselling creators as they have less market power and face large amounts of competition. This conflicts with the “harmony of interests assumption” and also empirical evidence in the paper contradict the idea that copyright provides financial independence for creators partly also due to superstar affect.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Increasing returns and social contagion in cultural industries. British Journal of Management, 10(s1), 61-72.\n|Abstract=A formal definition of cultural industries is developed following four distinct features of cultural goods: (a) oversupply, (b) quality uncertainty, (c) network effects and (d) demand reversal. Drawing on economic and socio-psychological notions of ‘network’, increasing returns and social contagion effects are distinguished. Increasing returns may govern the adoption of standards when choices are binary, social contagion explains the diffusion of cultural goods when choices are multiple. Together, the four structural features delineating cultural industries account for curious competitive dynamics prevalent in cultural markets, such as the notorious 10 : 90 proportionality (under which 10% of cultural goods account for 90% of the market), causal ambiguity about the reasons for success, and the formation of fashions. Six managerial recommendations are advanced, focusing on a criticial circulation point triggering self-sustaining diffusion patterns. Finally ‘project-based enterprises’ and ‘network forms of governance’ are identified as the organizational forms most suited to the dynamics of the cultural markets.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.10.s1.6/abstract\n|Reference=Burt (1987); Powell (1990); Abrahamson and Fombrun (1994); Bovasso (1996); Jones, Hesterly, and Borgatti (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In order to benefit from social contagion and increasing returns, goods in cultural industries have to reach a critical mass of circulation. \n* The managerial recommendations researchers derived from the structural features of the cultural industries are consistent with organizational forms favoring rapid responses in a climate of competition. \n* Analysis suggests that ‘critical mass management’ relies heavily on the integration of social structure in at least two ways (1) cultural industries draw from a pool of professionals that is not organized as a market; and (2) cultural industries are organized around ‘boundary spanning’ contacts who have the ability to cross social networks. \n* Analysis suggests that cultural exchange conditions favor a particular form of network governance.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

In this article we briefly review existing research on the open source phenomenon and discuss the utility of open source software research findings for many other fields. We categorize the research into three areas: motivations of open source software contributors; governance, organization, and the process of innovation in open source software projects; and competitive dynamics enforced by open source software. We introduce the articles in this special issue of Management Science on open source software, and show how each contributes insights to one or more of these areas.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0560\n|Link=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/courses/tdt10/curricula2010/P4-3-Krogh06.pdf\n|Reference=Mustonen (2003); Von Hippel (2005); Kuan (2002); Raymond (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results:\n\n*The authors propose a framework for organizing research on open source software, consisting of three areas: Motivations of Project Contributors, Governance, Organization, and the Process of Innovation, Competitive Dynamics: The Impact of Free.\n\nResearch on motivations of project contributors:\n\n*Early empirical work documented a range of motives for participation among project contributors, such as fun, enjoyment, reputation building, learning, and the private use value of the software being developed. \n\n*Theory followed, including the proposition that those who contributed code gained private benefit by signaling to prospective employers about their programming skills and thereby getting better jobs or salaries. A general argument on the private benefits that could accrue from engaging in the creation of public goods in the form of a “private-collective” model of innovation incentives is mentioned. \n\n*New research explores how motives produce a mix of outcomes, and how various motives interact to produce contributions to open source software projects. There are new insights on how firm participation, community participation, and technical design relate to the contributors’ motivations. \n\nResearch on Governance, Organization, and the Process of Innovation:\n\n*Researchers have shown interest in the challenge of governing open source software projects. Projects are based on contributions by many and sometimes thousands of volunteer developers. Volunteers can be divided into two groups: people who expect to receive rewards from contributing\nto open source software (investors), and people who do not (donators). Open source software projects may have succeeded at creating a new governance structure that reconciles the interests of people in both groups. \n\n*An emerging body of research has provided detailed accounts of open source software project organizations, highlighting a pronounced difference in roles taken by contributors.\n\n*New research shows innovation processes in open source software significantly deviate from predictions made by existing innovation theory. Case Studies and conceptual frameworks for understanding the unique character of, and the requirements for, innovation processes in open source software have been undertaken and developed.\n\nResearch on Competitive Dynamics: The Impact of Free:\n\n*Past research investigated how new technologies such as open source software can compete in an environment dominated by commercial technological standards, and a model for the impact of open source (copyleft) licensing on both the developer environment and the market for software was developed. This shows that although both commercial and open source software can coexist, scarcity of labour and product pricing must be taken into account. \n\n*Researchers also studied software firms that used open source software in delivering customized products. A framework of increasing resource allocation to open source software development showed that increased “public” investment can lead to great “private” benefits for open source–oriented firms.\n\n*New research focuses on understanding competitive dynamics. Researchers consider the mixed duopolies in which competing firms and others have heterogeneous objective functions; the technology platforms mediating competition in many industries and collaboration between firms and the open source software movement.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Content providers, such as media outlets and video subscription services, would like to ensure that their videos do not fail, startup quickly, and play without interruptions. In return for their investment in video stream quality, content providers expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer engagement, and a greater fraction of repeat viewers, resulting in greater revenues. The key question for a content provider or a CDN is whether and to what extent changes in video quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our work is the first to establish a causal relationship between video quality and viewer behavior, taking a step beyond purely correlational studies. To establish causality, we use QuasiExperimental Designs, a novel technique adapted from the medical and social sciences. We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior in a scientific data-driven manner by using extensive traces from Akamai’s streaming network that include 23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers, who watched an aggregate of 216 million minutes of 102 thousand videos over 10 days. To our knowledge, our work is the first to provide evidence that video stream quality causally impacts viewer behavior.\n|Authentic Link=https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ramesh/Site/HOME_files/imc208-krishnan.pdf\n|Link=https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ramesh/Site/HOME_files/imc208-krishnan.pdf\n|Reference=Dobrian et al.

We consider only on-demand videos in this study, leaving live videos for future work. We tracked the viewers and views for the chosen content providers for a period of 10 days (see\nFigure 4). Our data set is extensive and captures 23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers, where each viewer on average made 3.42 visits over the period and viewed a total of 32.2 minutes of video. In each visit, there were on average 2.39 views but only 1.96 unique videos viewed, indicating that sometimes the viewer saw the same video twice. The geography of the viewer was mostly concentrated in North America, Europe and Asia with small contributions from other continents (see Figure 5). More than half the views used cable, though fiber, mobile, and DSL were significant.\n|Data Year=10 day period\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Akami Stream Analyzer;\n|Method of Collection=Web analytic (online user trace data)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining), Correlation and Association, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Programming and broadcasting; Television programmes; Film and motion pictures;\n|Country=Global;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=23,000,000\n|Level of Aggregation=Views,\n|Data Material Year=10 days\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2415, 'title': 'Krishnan and Sitaraman', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

The service industries journal, 28(10), 1463-1481.\n|Abstract=In recent years, the popular channel to obtain record albums has shifted from purchasing compact discs to downloading MP3 files. In fact, digital music service (DMS), the industry that sells MP3 songs, has seen tremendous successes and is making hundreds of millions of dollars every year. However, few attempts have been made to understand the consumption behavior of this newly emerging market because it has its own characteristics that have made other behavioral models inapplicable. In this study, we surveyed college students, who are the most active in this market, concerning their DMS subscription behavior. A modified theory of planned behavior (TPB) model was used as the framework. This new model incorporates the technology acceptance model and a new construct, the perceived service quality, into the original TPB model. Based on the survey results, the present study depicts a model that explains subscription behavior and indicates that subjective norm has the most significant effect on the intention to subscribe. Also, features that potential subscribers found important are revealed. The results provide marketing implications for DMS providers and indicate possible direction for future studies.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02642060802250278#.VWOBqk9Viko\n|Reference=Ajzen and Fishbien (1980); Bakos, Brynjolfsson and Lichtman (1999); Carlson (2003); Srinivansan, Anderson and Ponnavolu (2002); Taylor and Todd (1995b);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Family, friends, colleagues, and peers heavily influences individuals' behaviours and attitudes towards illegal downloading.\n* Members of the target demographic are willing to spend money on entertainment of sufficient perceived quality.\n* Legal downloading can be encouraged by emphasizing individuality and fashionability of desirable products.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

In this study, the author proposed to discourage piracy intention by rectifying the self-positivity bias with message framing and information accessibility. Cartoon advertisements conveying either positively or negatively framed messages were produced. Respondents’ level of information accessibility of piracy behavior was manipulated. As predicted, using positively framed messages or increasing level of information accessibility can effectively reduce self-positivity bias. Moreover, in a low information accessibility scenario, positive rather than negative message framing is more effective in reducing self-positivity bias in using pirated products.

But a complete project requires the execution of “mundane but necessary” tasks as well. In this paper, we explore how the mundane but necessary task of field support is organized in the case of Apache web server software, and why some project participants are motivated to provide this service gratis to others. We find that the Apache field support system functions effectively. We also find that, when we partition the help system into its component tasks, 98% of the effort expended by information providers in fact returns direct learning benefits to those providers. This finding considerably reduces the puzzle of why information providers are willing to perform this task “for free.” Implications are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00095-1\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=290305\n|Reference=Lakhani (1999); Kollock (1999); Lerner and Tirole (2002); Raymond (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results: \n\n*The authors segmented an information transaction on Apache Usenet help into three subtasks: (1) a question must be posed; (2) the information sought must be matched to an appropriate and willing provider of information; (3) an answer must be provided. \n\n*98% of the time spent at the Apache online Usenet help site by providers is spent upon task (2)—reading questions and answers posted on the Usenet site.\n\n*The actual answering of questions (task (3)) took up only 2% of a information provider’s time on site, with providers reporting that they invested only l–5 min per question answered.\n\nBenefits of contributing include: \n\n*The expectation of reciprocity - someone will help them in their turn.\n\n*Helping the cause - strong identification with the open source community.\n\n*Reputation/Enhanced career prospects - answering lots of questions well and in a timely fashion builds reputation and can lead to career anhancement.\n\n*Intrinsic reward - answering questions is fun, rewarding and makes information providers feel competent.\n\n*Part of the job - some information providers may be answering questions as part of their employment, because there are commercial versions of Apache available.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

For example, it is interesting to discover that learning on the part of contributors is an important motivator in the case of the relatively “mundane” task of help-provision.\n\n*The learning gained can also help with the design of the next generation of open source projects and similar, user-based innovation systems.\n|Description of Data=The authors collected two types of data:\n\n*For data regarding long-term participation in CIWS-U (the Apache Usenet help forum) — who participated, long-term trends, etc. — the authors examined Usenet posting patterns from 1996 to 1999. This 4-year period spans essentially the entire history of online Apache help. The Usenet log data was obtained from a World Wide Web service called Deja.com (since acquired by Google). This service archives all of the discussion groups on the World Wide Usenet and makes available advanced search and parsing capability through their website (http://groups.google.com).\n\n*The authors collected questionnaire data from people who posted either questions or answers to CIWS-U during the 4.5 months from 1 October 1999 to 15 February 2000. During this time period, they monitored activity on CIWS-U near-continuously via computer. Within 3 days of when a question or an answer was posted on CIWS-U, a computer automatically detected whether the individual was posting a question (e.g. was starting a new “thread”) or was providing information related to a previously posted question (e.g. was referring to an existing thread in his or her posting). It then sent a version of a questionnaire (one appropriate to information seeking or one appropriate to information providing) to the email address of that individual.

In a multiple regression analysis, downloading activity was found to be positively related to deficient self-regulation and the expected social outcomes of downloading behavior. Downloading activity was lessened by dissatisfaction with poor quality downloads. Those who are willing to discontinue downloading are motivated by fear of punishment, but skilled and habitual downloaders were unlikely to discontinue. Normative beliefs also affected downloading. The perception that downloading was morally unacceptable was positively related to intentions to discontinue downloading, while beliefs that the behavior was morally acceptable were positively related to current downloading activity.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.tb00301.x/full\n|Reference=Ajzen (1985); LaRose, Mastro and Eastin (2001); LaRose and Eastin (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article intends to explore the motivations of illegal downloading while using its result to inform policy.

(2014). The Digital Intellectual Property Challenge Revisited: File-sharing and Copyright Development in Hungary.\n|Abstract=The challenge that illegal file-\xadsharing poses to legal criminalisation is addressed in this study. Nonetheless, the pretexts and reasons for the specific character of file-\xadsharing behaviour and norms in a community likely, to various degrees, correlate with the specifics in the legal regulation relating to a particular jurisdiction. Therefore, we argue for the importance of empirically studying both the legal development and the file-\xadsharing practices existing in parallel to the legal development within the domain’s specific jurisdiction. This study will elaborate quite extensively on the contemporary development and the status of copyright in Hungary. This is followed by a sample of Hungarian respondents to a survey on file-\xadsharing, which is then compared with a large set of global respondents in order to determine the specific character of the former sample — if such character is found.\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2530190\n|Reference=Panas and Ninni (2011); Gracz (2013); Feldman and Nadler (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Survey explores three questions:\n1.

What is the character of Hungarian IP regulation in relation to international treaties and trade agreements, enforcement, the role of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and its contemporary development in general?\n\n* Hungary stands out in the higher degree of use of other or private BitTorrent trackers which could be due to the weaker online law enforcement and the stronger fight against bootleg copies.\n* Due to their particular language, Hungarians are more motivated to set up and run their own darknet sites where copyrighted contents, mainly movies and TV-shows, are available in original releases along with translations.\n* The key motivation for file-sharers in Hungary seems to be the sites’ cost-free nature. If the price is high Hungarians most likely will not switch to subscription services or purchase works in hard copies.\n* File-sharing, therefore, seems to represent resistance to the pricing models of works rather than any expression of political opinion or ideology. None of these reasons has any relation to the emerging “pirate thinking” of file-sharers in Sweden or Germany\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10(2), 267-277.\n|Abstract=The music downloading phenomenon presents a unique opportunity to examine normative influences on media consumption behavior. Downloaders face moral, legal, and ethical quandaries that can be conceptualized as normative influences within the self-regulatory mechanism of social cognitive theory. The music industry hopes to eliminate illegal file sharing and to divert illegal downloaders to pay services by asserting normative influence through selective prosecutions and public information campaigns. However the deficient self-regulation of downloaders counters these efforts maintaining file sharing as a persistent habit that defies attempts to establish normative control. The present research tests and extends the social cognitive theory of downloading on a sample of college students. The expected outcomes of downloading behavior and deficient self-regulation of that behavior were found to be important determinantes of intentions to continue downloading. Consistent with social cognitive theory but in contrast to the theory of planned behavior, it was found that descriptive and prescriptive norms influenced deficient self-regulation but had no direct impact on behavioral intentions. Downloading intentions also had no direct relationship to either compact disc purchases or to subscription to online pay music services.\n|Authentic Link=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2006.9959\n|Link=http://beta.orionsshoulders.com/Resources/articles/26_18495_%20().pdf\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2286, 'title': 'Larsson et a (2014)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '#REDIRECT [[Larsson et al.

Survey methodology was used to determine the respondents’ perceived likelihood of\npurchasing legitimate CDs depending on the free availability of the same music via a streaming\nservice or downloading on the Internet. In the pre-study, several factors affecting consumer\npurchasing were identified based on the responses of 106 university students. In consideration of\nthese factors, the paper investigated how the price and free music availability jointly affect a\nconsumer’s willingness to buy. In addition, this paper examined how the effects of price and\nnon-price factors such as rating of singer, preference for genre, number of songs on a CD, SES\nfactors, and music consumption style may change in the “free” vs. “non-free” Internet\navailability conditions. The results showed that there was a weak pattern of interaction between\nprice and free music availability, though the interaction effect was not significant. In the non-free Internet availability situation, price along with some other factors had significant effects on consumer purchasing patterns for some CDs, whereas in the free Internet availability situation, price had insignificant effects on a consumer’s willingness to purchase all twelve CDs used in the questionnaire. Instead, some non-price factors influenced consumer purchasing patterns.\n|Authentic Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.544&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.544&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2003); Zentner (2003); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2004); Rob and Waldfogel (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Consumers’ willingness to buy is likely to plummet to an ‘average’ price level with the emerging free music;\n* Under the “nonfree” Internet availability situation, price had a statistically significant effect on consumers’ willingness to buy for some CDs and some non-price factors have significant effects as well, whereas under the “free” Internet availability situation, price had no significant effect on consumers’ willingness to buy.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Precarious Creativity: Changing Attitudes Towards Craft and Creativity in the British Independent Television Production Sector. Creative Industries Journal, 4(2), 155-170\n|Abstract=This article focuses on television workers’ attitudes towards craft and creative practice within the field of factual television production in the British independent  television production sector  (ITPS).  Based  on  longitudinal  qualitative  research, it  argues  that  a  radical  shift  has \noccurred in the professional values that television producers’  associate with their creative work, by  focusing  on  ethical  and  professional  norms  within  factual  television  production.  By considering  the  historical  and  contemporary discourse  of  ‘craft’  within  this  area  of  creative work,  the  article  interrogates  the  nature  of  the  changes  that  have  taken  place.  The  wider significance  of  these  changes  is  also  considered,  through  an  engagement  with  theoretical concerns about the place of craft within late modernity (Sennett 2006), and with debates about the  changes  that  have  taken  place  within  the  political  economy  of  independent  television production.  The  article’s  findings  have  contextual  significance  within  contemporary  debates about creative work (Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2010). Despite the celebratory policy rhetoric of the  ‘creative  industries’  (DCMS  1998),  the  transformed  production  environment  within contemporary British television has had a detrimental effect on skills retention an development, as well as on the potential for creativity within the industry.\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/76879/; http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/cij.4.2.155_1\n|Reference=Paterson (2001); Sennett (2006); Hesmondhalgh and Baker (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The author seeks to answer the question if commercialisation decreases production quality in British TV.\n* He conducted 20 interviews of people working within the British television industry.\n* Individuals interviewed agreed with the statement that factual TV had become more commercialized.\n* Found that traditional values associated with quality were seen to be under threat and that there has been a subsequent decline in standards.\n* Author continued by describing how Hollywood was mitigating risk and so becoming more homogenised spurred on by policies geared toward growth.\n* Independent sector, according to the author, depends on the industry and workers on the independents so creativity and innovation suffer. \n* The independent sector has become more consolidated, commercial and less independent.\n|FundamentalIssue=3.

However, improvers cannot always avoid the intellectual property rights of the basic work on which they wish to improve. Some improvements fall within the scope of the preexisting intellectual property right, either because of an expansive definition of that right or because economic or technical necessity requires that the improver hew closely to the work of the original creator in some basic respect.

Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 6(2‐3), 111-122.\n|Abstract=Abstract: \n\n*The study employs two experiments to examine the effectiveness of various strategies used to dissuade consumers from downloading music illegally. The research investigates two specific strategies that the recording industry has used: (1) fear or threat appeals (e.g., the threat of punishment, such as fines and/or jail time), and (2) attribution of harm (informing consumers of the harm caused by the illegal downloading of music, such as financial loss to either the artist or the recording company). The study also considers whether past illegal downloading behaviour reduces the effectiveness of these disincentive strategies. Finally, the impact of subjective norms (i.e., whether subjects think their friends would approve of downloading music) was also investigated.\n\n*Findings indicate a significant effect of threat appeal such that stronger threat appeals were found to be more effective than weaker threat appeals in reducing illegal downloading. The first study also showed that prior illegal downloading behavior does not curtail the effects of threat appeals aimed at reducing illegal downloading. In addition, results reveal no differences in downloading behavior in terms of attribution of harm deterrent strategy (harm to either the recording artist or company). The most interesting finding from the second study is that subjective norms appear to equalize low versus high past downloaders, but only under conditions of weak fear.\n\n*The current manuscript is the first to examine the impact of four different variables (threat appeals, attribution of harm, subjective norms, and previous downloadingbehavior) on subjects’ likelihood to illegally download music in the future. In particular, this research illuminates the potential importance of social norms in discouraging a type of undesirable consumer behavior but shows that this occurs only under a restricted set of conditions: when threat is low and the consumer is not a habitually high downloader. It should be of interest to those in fields where intellectual property can be pirated on the Internet.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cb.211/abstract\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mary_Conway_Dato-on/publication/229904728_Deterring_illegal_downloading_the_effects_of_threat_appeals_past_behavior_subjective_norms_and_attributions_of_harm/links/53f510480cf2888a749174a0.pdf\n|Reference=Fullerton, Kerch and Dodge (1996); Levin, Conway Dato-On and Rhee (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of the study: \n\n*The results of the two studies indicate that stronger threat appeals lessened the likelihood that students will download music in the future, and students who have downloaded many songs in the past are more likely to download in the future. \n\n*Contrary to our predictions, we found that attribution of harm had no impact on students’ intentions to download in the future. It is quite possible that college students, who are typically not yet financially independent, have a hard time believing that music artists and/or companies truly need the money that is lost due to downloading music. \n\n*The most interesting finding from study two was that social norms have a significant impact on future downloading behavior. In other words, college students do care what others think about them downloading songs without paying.\n\n*In particular, this research illuminates the potential importance of social norms in discouraging a type of undesirable consumer behavior but shows that this occurs only under a restricted set of conditions: when threat is low and the consumer is not a habitually high downloader.\n\n*For these consumers, the extra incentive of doing what others think is ‘cool’ compensates for low levels of threat but not for higher levels of threat. Current theories concerning the role of social norms in curbing undesirable forms of consumer behavior must consider the moderating role of factors like past behavioral patterns.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

National Bureau of Economic Research.\n|Abstract=The paper seeks to understand the impact of the patent system on innovation by examining shifts in the strength of patent protection across sixty countries and a 150-year period. An examination of 177 policy changes reveals that strengthening patent protection appears to have few positive effects on patent applications by entities in the country undertaking the policy change, whether filings in Great Britain or the nation making the policy change are considered. Cross-sectional analyses suggest that the impact of patent protection-enhancing shifts were greater in nations with weaker initial protection and greater economic development, consistent with economic theory. I address concerns about the endogeneity of these changes by employing an instrumental variable approach.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.nber.org/papers/w8977\n|Link=https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/8977.html\n|Reference=Sakakibara and Branstetter (2001); Kortum and Lerner (1998); Hall and Ziedonis (2001); Lanjouw (1998); Scherer and Weisburst (1995);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Adjusting for the change in overall patenting, the impact of patent protection-enhancing shifts on applications by residents was actually negative, whether filings in Great Britain or domestically were considered.\n\nThe cross-sectional differences in the impact of these shifts were largely consistent with the predictions of economic theorists. These findings are consistent with earlier case studies of individual policy changes.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

To explore these suggestions, I examine cross-sectional differences across these events. Consistent with theoretical suggestions, I find that patent protection-enhancing shifts have a lesser impact on innovation when the nation already has strong patent protection and when its per capita gross domestic product lags further behind other nations. These patterns continue to hold when I employ an instrumental variables approach, which partially addresses the concern that the timing of these policy changes is not exogenous.\n|Description of Data=In total, I ended up with 177 events in 51 out of the 60 nations in the sample. The first change in the sample occurred in 1852 and the last in 1998.

Some improvements fall within the scope of the preexisting intellectual property right, either because of an expansive definition of that right or because economic or technical necessity requires that the improver hew closely to the work of the original creator in some basic respect. Here, the improver is at the mercy of the original intellectual property owner, unless there is some separate right that expressly allows copying for the sake of improvement.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1274199\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1274199\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

N., & Liu, Y. P. (2010). Predicting the use of pirated software: A contingency model integrating perceived risk with the theory of planned behavior. Journal of Business Ethics, 91(2), 237-252.\n|Abstract=As software piracy continues to be a threat to the growth of national and global economies, understanding why people continue to use pirated software and learning how to discourage the use of pirated software are urgent and important issues. In addition to applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB) perspective to capture behavioral intention to use pirated software, this paper considers perceived risk as a salient belief influencing attitude and intention toward using pirated software. Four perceived risk components related to the use of pirated software (performance, social, prosecution and psychological risks) have been identified, measured and tested. Data were collected through an online survey of 305 participants. The results indicate that perceived prosecution risk has an impact on intention to use pirated software, and perceived psychological risk is a strong predictor of attitude toward using pirated software. In addition, attitude and perceived behavior control contribute significantly to the intended use of pirated software. However, the proposed direct relationship between subjective norm and intention to use pirated software is not supported. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0081-5\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225122249_Predicting_the_Use_of_Pirated_Software_A_Contingency_Model_Integrating_Perceived_Risk_with_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior\n|Reference=Campbell and Goodstein (2001); Featherman and Pavlou (2003); Jacoby and Kaplan (1972); Mitchell (1992); Tan (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Attitude and perceived behavioral control are significant antecedents of intention, but subjective norm is not a significant predictor of intention.\n\n* Therefore, an individual’s intention to use pirated software does not seem to be positively affected by the approval of significant others.\n\n* Perceived social risk is not a significant predictor of attitude and of intention toward using pirated software. This result is contradictory to Tan’s work (2002) in which social risk has a significant influence on intention to purchase pirated software.\n\n* Perceived psychological risk has a significant influence on attitude toward usage, but has no significant impact on behavioral intention to use pirated software.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

BSA emphasized that ‘‘software piracy negatively affects much more than just the industry. It also puts a strain on technology companies’ ability to invest in new jobs and new technologies; harms local retailers and services firms; lowers government tax revenues; and increases the risk of cyber crime and security problems.’’ Software piracy, therefore, continues to be a major challenge for economies throughout the world. Understanding why people engage in piracy behaviors is an increasingly important issue for management and practice. Accordingly, this study aims to develop and empirically test a model examining the antecedents of attitude and behavioral intention that cause individuals to engage in the use of pirated software.\n|Description of Data=A Web-based survey was conducted via an electronic questionnaire to verify the theoretical model.

This paper, however, shows that the unauthorized copying of intellectual properties need not be harmful and actually may be beneficial. The empirical impact of photocopying on publishers of journals is examined in an attempt to discover if publishers can indirectly appropriate revenues from users who are not original purchasers. The evidence indicates that publishers can indirectly appropriate revenues from users who do not directly purchase journals and that photocopying has not harmed journal publishers.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833064?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n|Reference=Besen (1984); Johnson (1985); Novos and Waldman (1984);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results: \n\n*Photocopying has not had a detrimental effect on publishers.\n\n*The pricing of commercial publishers is significantly more discriminatory than non-commercial publishers. \n\n*The age of the journal has little clear effect on the degree of price discrimination.\n\n*The existence of indirect appropriability is confirmed: the more intensive use of journal in libraries allows publishers to raise the price charged to libraries. \n\n*There is evidence that photocopying increased the price paid by libraries for journals relative to the price paid by individuals. \n\n*The emrgence of price discrimination was not limited to economics journals. \n\n*Growth in reprography has not coincided with a period of decline for journals.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

School of Management University of Texas Paper, September, 1-31.\n|Abstract=The transmission of digitized music files, particularly on filesharing networks, is having a profound impact on the consumption and production of music. Although previous forms of copying have been found to often have benign effects on copyright owners, the rise in file-sharing has coincided with a steep decline in the sale of sound recordings. This paper attempts to empirically examine whether file-sharing has caused the decline in record sales. It examines the size and pattern of file-sharing and its theoretical impact on record sales. Using a data set for 99 American cities containing information on Internet use, record sales, and other demographic variables, an econometric analysis is undertaken to explain the change in record sales before and after file-sharing. The results imply that file-sharing has caused the entire decline in record sales that has occurred and also appears to have vitiated what otherwise would have been fairly robust growth in the industry. Looking at sales in individual musical genres reinforces the primary conclusions. The record industry’s risky strategy of assiduously fighting filesharing, therefore, appears to have a rational basis.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/intprop/cities.pdf\n|Link=http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/intprop/cities.pdf\n|Reference=Varian (2005); Watt (2000); Liebowitz (2004); Blackburn (2004); Zentner (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*  The decline due to file -sharing appears to be larger than the measured decline—the regression results indicate that file-sharing not only reduced sales but also vitiated an increase that otherwise would have occurred\n\n*  When given the choice of free copies versus purchased originals, a significant number of individuals who might have purchased originals will chose to substitute the free copy.

This paper attempts to empirically examine the extent, if any, to which file-sharing has caused the decline in record sales. \nUsing a data set for 99 American cities containing information on Internet use, record sales, television viewing, radio listening, and other demographic variables, an econometric analysis is undertaken to examine the relationship between record sales and file-sharing, as proxied by Internet use, from 1998 to 2003. \n\nFirst, we find that the Internet itself reduces time spent on other entertainment activities, but only by a small amount. We then subtract this generic Internet impact from the overall Internet impact and conclude that the decline associated with that component of Internet use that we can attribute to file-sharing indicates that file-sharing has caused the entire decline in record sales and appears to have vitiated what otherwise would have been growth in the industry. Looking at sales in individual musical genres reinforces the primary conclusion since those genres that seem most likely to fall prey to file-sharing have the strongest measured negative impact from Internet usage.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0833?journalCode=mnsc\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=829245\n|Reference=Zentner (2005); Zentner (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Our results indicate that file-sharing indeed has caused the decline in record sales that coincided with the advent of file-sharing.\n\n* Examining the impact of Internet penetration on usage of the two most popular forms of entertainment, television viewing and radio listening, led to a conclusion that the Internet did indeed reduce consumption of these activities, although by a relatively small 7 to 13 percent.\n\n* The reduction in sales due to file-sharing appears to be larger than the actual measured decline in record sales—the regression results indicate that file-sharing not only reduced sales but also vitiated an increase that otherwise would have occurred. \n\n* The regressions imply that except for filesharing, there would have been an increase in record sales from 1998 through 2003 that was quite close to the historical industry average.\n\n* This analysis was repeated for individual genres of music. The results were consistent with basic intuition about different genres’ affinity for file-sharing. This would rule out alterative explanations of the sales decline that didn’t point to the same set of culprits as those involved with file-sharing.\n\n* The result of Internet file-sharing is damaging to business models, not by a superior replacement but by a parasitic use of an otherwise productive technology. \n\n* These problems may become far worse if other markets, such as movies and computer software, were to be sucked up in the file-sharing vortex\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Journal of Law and Economics, 49(1), 1-28.\n|Abstract=The impact of copying, in the form of file-sharing, has become a stormy policy issue. Previous copying technologies have mostly failed to live up to the extravagant predictions of harm that arose with those new technologies although precise measurements of copying's impact was rarely accomplished or attempted. One impediment to measuring the impact of copying with prior technologies was the difficulty of measuring copying activity. File-sharing is the newest technology for making copies and carries with it the possibility of more precise measurement of copying than has been possible in the past. This paper examines the measurement of file-sharing activity, the theory of file-sharing's likely impact, and the impact of file-sharing. Analysis of various data sets indicate that they do not yet live up to their hoped for precision. Data limitations not withstanding, the evidence seems compelling that file-sharing is responsible for the recent large decline in CD sales for which it has been blamed.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=646943\n|Reference=Blackburn (2004); Boorstin (2004); Liebowitz (2004); Michel (2004); Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004); Rob and Waldfogel (2004); Zentner (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- Given the flawed setup of recent surveys, it is likely that the impact of file-sharing is larger than what has been reported.\n\n- The pattern of file-sharing’s birth and rapid growth followed immediately by the unusually large decline in the sound recording market supports a claim that file-sharing is responsible for the decline in sales. Add to this the predictions of economic theory that file-sharing should lead to a decline in sales and we have what appears to be a very strong case that file-sharing is the cause of the decline.\n\n- Overall, the evidence appears to be that the lawsuits had an initial negative impact on files-haring, as hoped by the RIAA, but after this initial decline the impact of the lawsuits appears to be wearing off.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Economists examine file-sharing and music sales.Industrial organization and the digital economy, 145-174.\n|Abstract=At the center of the file-sharing debate is the empirical issue of whether or not file-sharing decreases sales. I should note that file-sharing can have a strong negative impact on sales even when a majority of downloads do not replace a sale. I am unaware of any serious analyst who has ever claimed a 1:1 relationship between an unauthorized copy and a lost sale, whether we are talking about photocopying or whether we are examining file-sharing. There are several estimates that the number of music files exchanged on file-sharing networks is larger than the number purchased through legitimate channels. If so, file-sharing could cause a ma jor loss of sales even if only a relatively small percentage. of unauthorized downloads translated into a lost sale. Nevertheless, estimates of the number of music\nfiles downloaded in file-sharing networks vary widely. In this paper I examine the different empirical methodologies that have been chosen in attempts to shed some light on this issue. These studies generally take different approaches in terms of their data analysis. The studies consistently find that file-sharing has led to a serious decline in record sales, except for one highly publicized study that reaches very different, and in my opinion, highly implausible conclusions.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/intprop/MIT.pdf\n|Link=http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/intprop/MIT.pdf\n|Reference=Watt (2004); Liebowitz (2004); Gayer and Shy (2004); Liebowitz (1985); Zentner (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The theory underlying the analysis of file-sharing has not received the attention it deserved. It has always been clear that some possible aspects of file-sharing would harm copyright owners, such as the substitution of copies for the purchase of originals. \n* What has not been understood is that the use of file-sharing to sample products is also likely to lead to harm to copyright owners. Theoretical conditions under which file-sharing might be beneficial to copyright holders seem farfetched. \n* A broad analysis of the various theoretical factors at work supports a view that file-sharing is likely to cause serious damage to the owners of copyright materials that are shared. \n* Empirical examinations need to meet a higher hurdle than normal before they might be considered to over tern the expectation that the birth of file sharing leads to the subsequent decline in CD sales. \n* The political arena is impatient in its search for an answer and for academics to reach unanimity. In any case, it seems that file-sharing hurts copyright owners and that it is responsible for most, if not all, of the recent decline in sales.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Then Napster arrived in the second half of 1999 and grew to be an international sensation during 2000. The sound recording industry in the US and throughout the world experienced a dramatic swoon in sales beginning in 2000, continuing unabated through 2010. The industry has blamed this sales decline on the growth of file-sharing. Although Napster was effectively shut down as an unauthorized file-sharing service within two years of its birth, its progeny live on, as do new habits of downloading developed by Internet users. Although it is clear that pirated versions of products often substitute for the purchase of an original, and this effect is unambiguously harmful to the industry, there are other, more subtle effects possibly at work, as well. One factor that has received a good deal of attention is the ‘sampling’ effect. For example, piracy could allow a consumer to discover new songs that then induce the consumer to go purchase the entire album containing those songs that might otherwise have not been purchased. This effect, first proposed in Liebowitz (1985), makes the theory of piracy somewhat ambiguous.\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2635, 'title': 'Liebowitz and Margolis (2005)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Liebowitz and Margolis (2005)\n|Author=Liebowitz, SJ; Margolis, SE\n|Title=Seventeen famous economists weigh in on copyright: The role of theory, empirics, and network effects\n|Year=2005\n|Full Citation=Liebowitz, S.

Readers would have every reason to believe that the arguments set\nforth in this document are sound down to the smallest details. Yet this is not the case.

However, there are other important considerations that might reverse this conclusion. \n\n* The economists’ second point (new works) is not as clear-cut and is incompletely explored in the brief.\n\n* The data that economists would need, but do not have, include (1) the number and value of new works created as a result of extensions of copyright duration; (2) the reduction of surplus for reproductions of copyrighted materials under extended copyright, relative to the surplus that would be generated if copyright protection were less lengthy\n\n* There is a possibility that for some authors, in some range of income and propensity to create, a small increase in present value could make an important difference in creative output, perhaps because they reach a point where they switch to full-time writing\n\n* An unpublished empirical research carried out by Lebowitz in the 1980s back up anecdotal evidence — that the distribution of book sales is very highly skewed toward the more successful book titles. \n\n* More than half of the best-sellers in the 236 sample remained in print for a long enough period of time that the 1976 extension to the copyright law would likely have affected the present value of future book sales \n\n*  Even for non-best-sellers, a third still survived after fifty-eight years, indicating that a fairly significant share of other important books would likely be affected by changes in copyright law even when the copyright term is quite long.\n\n* The inferences about depreciation rates of books drawn from overall survival rates are likely to be misleading.

It has been common in previous analyses of moral public debates about new forms of media consumption to focus on conservative top-down hegemonic processes of reinstating order. The classic moral panic literature overemphasizes control, power and hegemony while overlooking counter-discourses. This study, on the other hand, takes such forms of symbolic resistance into account. It relies on a comparative discursive network analysis of texts produced by corporate news organizations and of blogs representing pro-piracy perspectives. It is concluded that with the blurring of the boundaries between producers and consumers of content, more and more localized moral panics that are not necessarily hegemonic are likely to be seen. Panic reactions can run not only from the top down but also from the bottom up as niche and micro media instigate their own moral panics.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2012.757632\n|Link=http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:612689/FULLTEXT02.pdf\n|Reference=Lessig (2004); Gantz and Rochester (2005); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Hinduja (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* While news and blog discourse on online piracy overlap, and often deal with similar themes, these representational spaces are still discernible as two distinct contexts of meaning production, each adhering to its own logic and can be conceived of as “linguistic fields”.\n*  Both discourses revolve around issues of morality and ethics.\n* Both use the characteristics of moral panic discourse, casting the other side as 'folk devils'.\n* This means that  the original moral panic model should be revised to allow for the notion that moral entrepreneurship can be exercised in hegemonic as well as counter-hegemonic directions.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Lewis & Clark Law Review, Vol. 16, No. 1, p. 215, 2012.\n|Abstract=An interesting yet less explored aspect of the eBay decision, in which the Supreme Court upheld the four-factor test under traditional principles of equity in the patent injunction context, is that the decision referred to what it characterized as long-term practice in copyright law to support the equitable power of lower courts to deny permanent injunctions. This ruling was made against the backdrop of widespread patent holdup where patent owners used the threat of injunctive relief to extract royalties grossly disproportionate to the value of the patented feature to the whole product. The holdup problem, however, is not equally obvious in copyright law. \n\nA close examination of the copyright cases cited in eBay reveals that they are hardly compelling authorities with respect to copyright injunction. The history of copyright law appears to suggest that injunctive relief was routinely available to copyright owners who had succeeded on the merits. More remarkably, empirical evidence shows that the majority of post-eBay decisions on copyright injunctions have totally ignored the eBay decision as well as the four-factor test advocated therein. Even among the cases that did cite eBay, most courts were reluctant to withhold injunctive relief upon a finding of copyright infringement. \n\nThis Article argues that the traditional practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of judges. Copyright holdup is much less pervasive than patent holdup, as interchangeable copyrighted works abound in the marketplace, and copyright law contains built-in mechanisms to control the holdup problem. Copyright injunctions also involve a distinct set of policy concerns, such as reputational harm, fair use, statutory damages, and freedom of speech. Hence, this Article proposes several approaches to reconcile the unique concerns in copyright law and the four-factor test mandated by eBay, with a focus on three scenarios that are particularly susceptible to the holdup problem.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1869390\n|Reference=Golden (2007); Barten (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This Article examines how much the eBay decision has guided, and should guide, copyright cases and it argues that the historical practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of the judges. More specifically, it argues that: \n\n* Contrary to recent media outcries about “copyright trolls,” the holdup problem envisaged in eBay is likely to be much less pervasive under copyright law than under patent law.\n\n* Nevertheless, copyright holdup may still arise in a limited number of cases that involve innocent infringement, substantial redesign costs, and small value of a copyrighted component relative to the overall product.\n\n* The eBay decision was neither rooted in the well-established practice of copyright law nor effective in altering the adjudication of subsequent copyright injunctions.\n\n* While the eBay decision promoted a nuanced, case-by-case approach to handling motions for injunctive relief, it might just be teaching a lesson against a general rule that a patent doctrine would automatically work for copyright law.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Indiana Law Journal, Forthcoming; Stanford Law and Economics Olin Working Paper No. 463.\n|Abstract=Conventional wisdom suggests that copyright piracy may in effect reduce the deadweight loss resulting from copyright protection because it allows the public unlimited access to information goods at a price closer to marginal cost. It has been further contended that lower copyright protection would benefit the society as a whole, as long as authors continue to receive sufficient incentives from alternative revenue streams in any ancillary markets, e.g. touring, advertising and merchandizing. By evaluating the empirical evidence from the music, performance and videogame markets, this article highlights a counterintuitive yet important point: Copyright piracy, while decreasing the deadweight loss in the music market, could simultaneously increase the deadweight loss in ancillary markets via the interaction between complementary goods. The deadweight loss in ancillary markets tends to become dominant if a substantial portion of relevant consumers have high valuation but low frequency in music consumption, are risk averse towards upfront payment with uncertain demand, and/or discount future value at a high rate. Additionally, the findings shed new lights on the current debates on several competing propositions to reform indirect copyright liabilities in the digital.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1869393\n|Reference=Bouldrin and Levine (2009); Anderson (2009); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*The author hypothesises that due to increased file sharing artists cannot recoup their investment from sales of their work so they need to turn to alternative sources of income like derivative goods and merchandise.\n\n* The author extends the idea that this causes a deadweight loss in the performance and other derivative markets because the artists need to price concert tickets higher than before in order to recoup losses from making the album for example.\n\n* Thus, according to the author, piracy in the music industry could decrease deadweight loss in the song market but increase it in derivative markets. \n\nThe author focused on 4 areas\n1. Alternative Revenue Streams\n2. iPod and iTunes\n3. Recorded Music and Live Performance\n4. Indirect Copyright Liabilities – Public Levy and Private Ordering\n\n* The author found the hypothesis to be supported by sales  data. Comparing sales/price data to the consumer price index and seeing that the sales prices rose more in comparison to the consumer price index, for example.\n\n* The author concluded by urging not to narrow the boundaries of property rights and instead help facilitate  voluntary transactions between market players and for them on their own to discover which combination of music licensing and alternative sources of revenue was best.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Following Png and Wang (2006), the production equation of recorded music is developed. Meanwhile, the author introduces other independent variables such as per capita GDP, employment rate and R&D, population and economic openness. The econometric methods consist of two way fixed effects method, Arellano-Bond dynamic panel-data estimation and dynamic panel-data estimation, one-step difference GMM (generalized method of moments) by use of Stata 10.0. The findings are as followings: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection exerts positive effect on recorded music sales, and the influencing coefficient is at the range of 0.815 to 0.915. Meanwhile, economic openness also has positive influence. The studying results suggest that IPRs protection can reinforce the sale of recorded music, and it is very urgent to enhance IPRs protection.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11459-011-0129-1\n|Reference=Png and Wang (2006); Zhu (2007); Park (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study indicates that strengthened intellectual property rights can positively influence music sales, based on factors including GDP, economic openness, population, and employment rate.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The findings reject the pervasive position that Chinese culture resists software copyright and encourages piracy behaviors. Instead, the study reports that Chinese culture has no significant impact on users’ intentions to use pirated software programs. Meanwhile, collectivistic and individualistic cultural components are found to coexist in the Chinese value system. The users with higher scores in the collectivistic component have more negative attitudes towards software companies, while the users with higher scores in the individualistic component have less negative attitudes towards software products. The coexistence of individualistic and collectivistic components prevents software users from falling into either direction of supporting or opposing software copyright and calls for a balanced account between software owners and users.\n|Authentic Link=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/11/8/1372.full.pdf\n|Reference=Wang et al.

This provides the grounds for the argument that Chinese culture resists software copyright and encourages piracy. However, when Chinese culture is empirically tested over individual users, the study is conducted within Chinese culture and with individuals as units of analysis so as to generate the different results.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2007). Secrets Revealed: How Magicians Protect Intellectual Property Without Law. http://ssrn.com/abstract=1005564\n|Abstract=Intellectual property scholars have begun to explore the curious dynamics of IP's negative spaces, areas in which IP law offers scant protection for innovators, but where innovation nevertheless seems to thrive. Such negative spaces pose a puzzle for the traditional theory of IP, which holds that IP law is necessary to create incentives for innovation. \n\nThis paper presents a study of one such negative space which has so far garnered some curiosity but little sustained attention - the world of performing magicians. This paper argues that idiosyncratic dynamics among magicians make traditional copyright, patent, and trade secret law ill-suited to protecting magicians' most valuable intellectual property. Yet, the paper further argues that the magic community has developed its own set of unique IP norms which effectively operate in law's absence. The paper details the structure of these informal norms that protect the creation, dissemination, and performance of magic tricks. The paper also discusses broader implications for IP theory, suggesting that a norm-based approach may offer a promising explanation for the puzzling persistence of some of IP's negative spaces.\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1005564\n|Reference=Raustiala and Springman (2006); Fauchart and Hippel (2006); Buccafusco (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Copyright law does not allow for the idea or the method of operation to be copyright, which are the core of the magicians IP, thus copyright is not very effective in protecting magicians IP.\n\n* Magic community has developed a unique set of informal norms and sanctions for violators, which protect intellectual property in the absence of law. Hence,  there is a need for intellectual property but not IP law specifically.\nThese norms include  an exclusive magic community which protects their secrets from being misappropriated from individuals not belonging to it. If individuals belonging to it do so they are subject to punishment by the community. Thus creating an incentive to keep the secrets within this exclusive community. \n\n* The article also points out that there  could be a solution where a trade secret protection could be allowed to magic tricks. People belonging to the community could have access to these trade secrets but anyone leaking trade secrets could face legal sanctions., which would be consistent with the societal norms within the magic community and hence  efficient legal  protection. This compared to the courts relying on intra-industry competition.\n|FundamentalIssue=1. Relationship between protection (subject matter/term/scope) and supply/economic development/growth/welfare, 4.

Journal of Consumer Marketing, 25(3), 167-178.\n|Abstract=Purpose – Illegal downloading of music has become an inexorable and rampant activity particularly among college students who have been little deterred by industry legal actions. The purpose of this research is to examine the present state of downloading and how ethical orientation and attitudes towards MP3 piracy impact such activities. This paper also aims to use ethical scenarios as a way of understanding the ethical reasoning in illegal downloading.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Key research questions are proposed that are related to illegal downloading. A sample of 364 university students was used to examine each research question. Statistical results are reported.\n\nFindings – The results clearly show that downloading continues at a high rate today driven by strong belief that it is not ethically wrong. Ethical orientation was found to be positively associated with awareness of the social cost of downloading, consequences of downloading, and ethical belief in downloading. Ethical scenarios show that ethical orientation is also associated with downloading activities and with stealing. Other results indicate that respondents believe that their peers are more prone to stealing music and downloading MP3s illegally. Fear of consequences does seem to have an impact on the propensity to download illegally.\n\nPractical Implications – The paper contributes to inform industry representatives that appeal to ethic or guilt are not likely to deter illegal downloading measurably. The use of punishment for downloaders may have a short-term effect but other (more positive) measures are required.\n\nOriginality/value – No research has examined downloading MP3s in the manner developed in this paper. The paper contributes to a better understanding of consumer behavior among those who download. The results provide insight into a serious problem in the recording industry that is likely to persist in the distant future unless sound measures are developed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/07363760810870662\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Lysonski/publication/49244141_Digital_Piracy_of_MP3s_Consumer_and_Ethical_Predispositions/links/5416fd6f0cf2788c4b35fab1.pdf\n|Reference=Lysonski and Gaidis (1991); Kwong, Yau, Lee, Sin and Tse (2003); D'Astous, Colbert and Montpetit (2005); Kwong and Lee (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article aims at examining how beliefs about music piracy, motives and practices as well as ethical orientations and attitudes relate to illegal downloading. More precisely, this research shows that:\n\n*Past behavior is likely to condition future behavior through a habituation effect.\n\n*Appealing to students using a guilt appeal is not likely to be effective.\n\n*There is a disconnection between a student’s ethical nature and their social and ethical beliefs about downloading.\n\n*Intentions to download are associated with beliefs that there is no social cost to downloading; there are social benefits to downloading; it is ethical to download; and there are legal consequences to downloading.\n\n*The fear of punishment (i.e. consequences of downloading) does have a negative impact on the intention to commit downloading.\n\n*Students are in the middle of the scale in expressing their likelihood of downloading such music and are more “considerate” to artists who have been less successful. Also, students believe that their peers are more likely than they to engage in unethical acts concerning stealing music in stores or on line.\n\n*Students’ ethics do have an impact on the propensity to engage in stealing music from a store or online, especially their ethical idealism.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

However, if ethical idealism can be increased, there is likely to be heightened consciousness about downloading.\n\n- The efficacy of using a guilt appeal as considered by the RIAA is questionable given the findings.\n\n- People may not identify ethics as an issue when it comes to nonphysical/tangible goods like digital files, as research on copying software seems to suggest.\n\n- If people suspect that they would be caught and punished, then they are less likely to download illegally. From this perspective, RIAA’s decision to file lawsuits against some people, prosecute them, and disseminate such news is likely to have some impact.\n|Description of Data=The total sample was 364 representing 156 males and 208 females.

Tulane Public Law Research Paper, (14-2).\n|Abstract=From a utilitarian perspective, devising an optimal copyright regime requires a simple\nbalancing of copyright’s benefits against its costs in order to maximize the resulting social welfare. While simple in theory, this balance has proven surprisingly difficult to achieve in practice. In part, this difficulty arises because the data available is inevitably limited, and often observational, and so the conclusions are fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty. In part, it arises because there are vested political interests that do not want an optimal copyright regime. Rather, they seek a copyright regime that maximizes their own welfare, whatever that may be.As a result, whatever data is available, and whatever uncertainty or ambiguity remains, they will twist in order to ensure that copyright serves them, rather than society as a whole. Whether due to the first problem or the second, there are also surprisingly few empirical studies of the costs and benefits associated with broadening or narrowing copyright. This study aims to help fill that gap by examining how file sharing has affected the creation and dissemination of new original\nmusic.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2372630\n|Reference=Holder (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=In this paper, empirical evidence shows that file sharing did not reduce the creation of new hit songs. Even if we assume that file sharing caused the decline in record sales which paralleled file sharing’s rise, the decline in record sales had two effects relevant to the creation of new music. First, it shifted output along the music-other margin and led to fewer new artists, as some individuals, given the lower returns available in music, decided to devote their time and creativity elsewhere. Second, it shifted output along the work-leisure margin and led to more new music from existing artists, as the lower returns led existing artists to substitute work for leisure. Because the second marginal effect outweighed the first, file sharing, even assuming that it caused the decline in record sales, led to the creation, on balance, of more new hit songs.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

S. (2012). Copyright’s Mercantilist Turn: Do We Need More Copyright or Less?. Tulane Public Law Research Paper, (12-20).\n|Abstract=Over the last twenty years, arguments for broader copyright have taken an increasingly mercantilist turn. Rather than argue for broader copyright in terms of more or better original works, proponents have begun arguing for broader copyright on the basis of revenue and jobs. Consumer copying is theft or piracy, proponents insist, depriving copyright owners of revenue and destroying jobs. In this article, I review these arguments and show that they are empty. While the Internet and digital technology has made widespread consumer copying a reality, broader copyright can be justified only if this copying has interfered with the creation and dissemination of new original works. But it has not. Using a hand-coded data set examining the number of new artists and cover songs in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the first week of each month for the years 1990-2010, I show that while music industry revenue has fallen sharply since Napster opened its virtual doors, output in the music industry, both in terms of quantity and quality, has increased just as sharply. Part of the explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result, is that the digital revolution, while it has made consumer copying trivially easily, has also reduced costs, risks, and barriers to entry in the music industry. Yet, this cannot be a complete explanation.\n\nTo account for the rest, I offer a theoretical model and a simple explanation for why the incentives for music creation have remained sufficient in the face of widespread consumer copying: Consumers don’t just love music generally; they love their particular favorite artists and their specific favorite songs. While consumers would like to get music for free, they know that they have to support their favorite artists in order to get and to continue getting the music they want. As a result, self-interest tends to ensure that consumers do not free ride too much.

Tulane Public Law Research Paper, (12-20).\n|Abstract=Over the last twenty years, arguments for broader copyright have taken an increasingly mercantilist turn. Rather than argue for broader copyright in terms of more or better original works, proponents have begun arguing for broader copyright on the basis of revenue and jobs. Consumer copying is theft or piracy, proponents insist, depriving copyright owners of revenue and destroying jobs. In this article, I review these arguments and show that they are empty. While the Internet and digital technology has made widespread consumer copying a reality, broader copyright can be justified only if this copying has interfered with the creation and dissemination of new original works. But it has not. Using a hand-coded data set examining the number of new artists and cover songs in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the first week of each month for the years 1990-2010, I show that while music industry revenue has fallen sharply since Napster opened its virtual doors, output in the music industry, both in terms of quantity and quality, has increased just as sharply. Part of the explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result, is that the digital revolution, while it has made consumer copying trivially easily, has also reduced costs, risks, and barriers to entry in the music industry. Yet, this cannot be a complete explanation.\n\nTo account for the rest, I offer a theoretical model and a simple explanation for why the incentives for music creation have remained sufficient in the face of widespread consumer copying: Consumers don’t just love music generally; they love their particular favorite artists and their specific favorite songs. While consumers would like to get music for free, they know that they have to support their favorite artists in order to get and to continue getting the music they want. As a result, self-interest tends to ensure that consumers do not free ride too much. While the resulting market is unlikely to be perfect, legislation from Congress is not likely to improve the situation. Just as product markets fail in predictable circumstances, so too do political markets. When, as in the debate over broader copyright, proposed legislation benefits a concentrated interest group, such as copyright owners, at the expense of a dispersed interest group, such as copyright consumers, Congress is systematically likely to get the answer of how much copyright is optimal wrong, and badly wrong at that.

SSRN eLibrary.\n|Abstract=The availability of digital distribution channels raises many new challenges for managers in the media industries. This is particularly true for movie studios where content can be stolen and released through illegitimate digital distribution channels before, or shortly after, the legitimate release date. In response to this potential threat, movie studios have spent millions of dollars attempting to protect their content from unauthorized release, to prosecute those who might distribute or consume pirated content, and to lobby governments to strengthen anti-piracy laws.\nHowever, surprisingly, there has been very little rigorous research to analyze whether,\nand how much, movie piracy cannibalizes legitimate sales. In this paper, we analyze\nthis question in the context of pre-release movie piracy. Using data collected from a\nunique Internet file-sharing site, we find that pre-release piracy significantly reduces a\nmovie’s market potential, although movies with pre-release piracy exhibit a slower sales\ndecline over time. We estimate that the net effect of pre-release piracy is approximately\na 15% reduction in box office sales.\nOur study contributes to the growing literature on piracy and digital media consumption in the Information Systems community by presenting evidence of the impact of Internet-based movie piracy, by taking a pre-release perspective to strengthen causal inference, and by differentiating the effect of pre-release movie piracy from the other types of piracy that the extant literature has previously considered.\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228280129_The_Effect_of_Pre-Release_Movie_Piracy_on_Box-Office_Revenue/links/000060a80cf270e24c893abd.pdf; http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1782924\n|Reference=Sawhney and Eliashberg (1996); Eliashberg, Elberse and Leenders (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study finds that prerelease pirating reduces box office income by 15%, and higher quality audio and video in a pirated film have less of an impact on box office income than lower quality counterparts.  This behaviour may act as a substitute for moviegoing or, through word of mouth, may increase sales over time; there is a possibility for prerelease pirating to act as promotion; however, it has the potential to come at the cost of cannabilisation of box office sales if the quality of the movie is low and word-of-mouth is not strong.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2004). Artists, musicians and the internet. Pew Internet & American Life Project.\n|Abstract=This is the first large-scale study that looks at artists’ and musicians’ use of the internet and their views on copyright.  The Pew Internet & American Life Project’s \ninterest in studying artists and musicians grew out of our previous work studying internet users’ consumption of music and other creative content online. Through a series of reports on music downloading and file-sharing, we have observed and documented the changing behaviors and attitudes of an American public learning to negotiate the ever-changing copyright landscape of the digital world.\n\nHowever, over the course of observing the explosive growth and persistence of peer-to-\npeer networks, and following the entertainment industry’s ongoing efforts to police these activities and promote licensed digital music services, we found that there were few sources of quantitative research directed at understanding how these issues affect both musicians and the greater creative community. We found ourselves hard-pressed to answer some of the most basic questions about artists and the internet. For instance, how many artists have access to the internet? How many promote and sell their work online? How are they using the internet to develop their work, their connections to other artists, or their connections to audiences and the \nworld-at-large? How do they feel about controversies over copyright and fair use of creative material in the heyday of peer-to-peer systems like the original Napster and the current Kazaa and BitTorrent?  \n\nThe debate about copyright in the digital era has primarily centered on the recording \nindustry’s opposition to unauthorized file-sharing and downloading, a stance that has \nbeen both lauded and criticized by popular musicians. This clash over new technology \ngrows out of a long history of disputes between business and artists about the proper \nbalance between creators, the people who pay for and market creations, and consumers \nwho want access to large catalogs of digital music files and argue that there are many non-infringing uses of peer-to-peer. While music has been at the forefront of this discussion, the movie industry has also recently began suing individual downloaders. \n\nIn our surveys between 2000 and 2003, we found growing numbers of music downloaders who said they didn’t care about the copyright on the files they were acquiring. Technology firms accommodated this demand by creating and marketing an ever-widening array of devices to copy and store music files. Moreover, the growth of home broadband connections has made it progressively easier to share and download \nMP3 files. The recording industry’s response to this apparent apathy towards copyright and the ease of getting free files online was to file more than 7,000 lawsuits directed against alleged file-sharers since September 2003. After the first legal actions by the RIAA, the number of people who said in our surveys that they \ndownloaded music files dropped dramatically but has since rebounded to a degree.\n\nEconomic analysis of recorded music sales data and its relationship to music file-sharing activity is ongoing. At the same time, there is much to be learned from studying developments on the ground level. In the end, the future of any industry whose content can be digitized hinges on the creativity and innovation of artists.  \nBut there are strong concerns within the artistic community, and by prominent legal \nscholars, about the effectiveness of current copyright terms and their enforcement in the online world. Some argue that our understanding of copyright law has strayed far from its original purpose and that the internet calls for an inherently different interpretation of what constitutes copyright infringement and what qualifies as fair use of digitized works. Furthermore, many have raised concerns about the practical difficulties of the permissions process for creators and that too few new works are passing into the public domain. \n\nArtists are avid consumers as well as creators of online content. They often borrow from previous works and use that for inspiration for their own creativity. They represent the leading edge of media consumption online. Yet artists’ perspectives and first-hand experiences with the internet – both those of musicians and the larger creative community – have rarely been examined at the national level.\n\nThere are good reasons for this apparent gap in studying artists as consumers as well as producers. They are a notoriously difficult group to define with objective measures and are often prohibitively expensive to contact in large numbers. Musicians, in particular, are often required to travel extensively, which makes them difficult to reach with traditional telephone survey methods. \n\nThe Pew Internet & American Life Project has undertaken several research initiatives to begin to probe these issues of how musicians and artists use the internet and how they feel about the copyright issues that have emerged in the digital age. There were three core research instruments for this study. The findings from these three surveys, while covering similar themes, are discussed in separate sections of the report in order to emphasize the important methodological \ndifferences between the samples. Additionally, each sample serves a different purpose, so we anticipate that some readers will appreciate having the data presented discretely in the sections that follow. \n\nThe national sample of self-identified artists allowed us to ask questions of a broad, random, and representative sample of self-identified artists from around the country, to gather baseline data on internet use by a wide range of artists in the U.S. and probe their opinions on copyright issues online. However, reflecting both the well-known challenges of recruiting artists for research purposes and the conventional wisdom about the small number of career artists in the U.S., this sample was limited in its ability to include a large number of artists who rely almost exclus\nively on artistic work for their livelihood.  \n\nThe sample of online musicians, while not representative, allowed us to reach several \nthousand respondents, including a substantial portion of career musicians (those we \ndefine as “Success Stories” and “Starving Musicians” in the report) who have a \nconsiderable stake in discussing both the positive and negative effects of free \ndownloading online. The musician survey, because it was administered online, also gave us a chance to ask a more thorough list of questions about the internet that was uniquely catered to musical performers and songwriters.  \n\nFinally, the random and nationally representative sample of American adults provided a glimpse of how the views and experiences of average consumers compare to those of the creative public.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2004/PIP_Artists.Musicians_Report.pdf.pdf\n|Link=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2004/PIP_Artists.Musicians_Report.pdf.pdf\n|Reference=Rainie (2000); Butler (2000);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study: \n\n*32 million Americans consider themselves artists and about 10 million of them get some kind of compensation for their creations and performances.  \n\n*More than three-quarters of all artists, 77%, and 83% of Paid Artists use the internet, compared to 63% of the entire population. Many site specific gains in their careers from their use of the internet.  \n\n*52% of all online artists and 59% of Paid Online Artists say they get ideas and inspiration for their work from searching online.  \n\n*30% of all online artists and 45% of Paid Online Artists say the internet is important in helping them create and/or distribute their art.  \n\n*23% of all online artists and 41% of Paid Online Artists say the internet has helped them in their creative pursuits and careers. \n\n*4% of all online artists and 8% of Paid Online Artists say the internet has made it much harder for their work to get noticed. \n\n*3% of all online artists and 6% of Paid Online Artists say the internet has had a major deleterious effect on their ability to protect their creative works.\n\n*Two-thirds of the musicians in the online survey say the internet is “very important” in helping them create and distribute their music. \n\n*90% of musicians use the internet to get ideas and inspiration.\n\n*87% of musicians use it to promote, advertise and post their music online. \n\n*83% of musicians offer free samples online and notable numbers report benefits from that such as higher CD sales, larger concert attendance, and more radio play.\n\n*77% have their own Web site.\n\n*69% sell their music somewhere online.\n\n*66% use the internet to collaborate with others. Many independent musicians, in particular, see the internet as an alternative way to bypass traditional distribution outlets.   \n\n*Artists say the current copyright laws do a good job of protecting the rights of creators and most have no qualms about the length of copyright protection that the law currently allows. \n\n*64% of all artists and 67% of Paid Artists think that the copyright owner should have complete control over the use of that work.  \n\n*Half of all artists say that copyright regulations generally benefit purveyors of art work more than the original creators. Musicians echo those views. \n\n*Just 28% of artists consider file-sharing to be a major threat and 30% of Paid Artists say this. Among the musicians in our online survey, two-thirds say file-sharing poses a minor threat or no threat at all.  \n\n*19% of Digitized Artists say unauthorized copies of their works have been posted online.  \n\n*52% of all artists and 55% of Paid Artists believe it should be illegal for internet users to share unauthorized copies of music and movies over file-sharing networks, compared to 37% of all artists and 35% of Paid Artists who say it should be legal. \n\n*Artists are evenly divided in their assessment about whether file-sharing programs are a net good or a net bad for their colleagues, while the musicians we surveyed are more likely to see the positive aspects of file-sharing. \n\n*47% of all artists agree with the statement that “file-sharing services are bad for artists because they allow people to copy or use an artist’s work without getting permission or compensating the artist.”\n\n*43% agree that, “file-sharing services aren’t really bad for artists, since they help to promote and distribute an artist’s work to a broad audience.”  \n\n*When asked about burning a copy of a music or movie CD for a friend, artists’ views become sharply divided; 46% think it should be legal, and 48% say it should be illegal. Paid Artists are marginally more likely to consider CD burning to be an infringing behavior. \n\n*46% of artists believe that it should be legal to send a digital copy of music over the internet to someone they know, but 49% say it should be illegal. \n\n*The musicians we surveyed were similarly divided over burning a CD for a friend; 47% think this should be legal while 41% think it should be illegal. However, most say that sending a digital copy of music over the internet to someone they know should be permitted. \n\n*Of those artists who download music files (n=118), most think that downloading has not really changed the total amount they spend on music purchases like CDs, concerts, or other music products (58% say this). \n\n*29% of artists say they think downloading has actually increased what they spend on music purchases overall, and 13% say it has decreased their purchases. \n\n*Among artists who either download music or video files (n=139), 86% say that when they download files for free, they usually end up supporting the artist or author in other ways, such as buying a CD or book or going to a performance. \n\n*Just over half of all artists who download music or video files say they can’t always tell if it’s legal or illegal to download media files from the internet. \n\n*More than two-thirds of the sample said they don’t currently pay to download any type of media files, but they would if the price, quality and choice they want become available.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Given the widespread use of the internet to illegally obtain copies of music and movies, it is important to understand the factors in this form of piracy as well. This study applied the self-control perspective to examine the attitudes of high school students toward the internet piracy of music and movies. Attitudes toward the internet piracy of music and movies were related to self-control, biological sex, internet experience, affiliation with deviant peers, and grade level in this study of high school students. This information is important because studies of internet piracy had not yet confirmed the presence and predictability of internet piracy in high school students. This study also suggests that piracy prevention efforts may be most appropriately focused on high school age individuals and directed toward increasing self-control.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209000028\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/223882003_Adolescent_self-control_and_music_and_movie_piracy\n|Reference=Bhattachariee, Gopal and Sanders (2003); Grottfredson and Hirschi (1990); Higgins and Makin (2004); Higgins (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Although college students have the highest rate of music and movie piracy, this study indicates that attitudes towards illegal downloading progressively develop in high school and piracy is most frequent amongst adolescents with a low level of self-control as well as negative attitudes towards rules and authority.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

To this end we rely on a survey comprising behavior and attitudes at the individual level. The sample matches some demographic characteristics of the German population with high-speed internet access with regard to gender and age composition. It also maps the share of foreign nationals in Germany. Self-selection in the drawing of our sample is assessed by a control experiment. In contrast to existing studies, we sharply discriminate between frequency and extent of pirating digital media. We find no significant gender difference in the propensity to pirate. However, male individuals are prone to pirate at a significantly larger scale.We attribute this finding to male individuals acting more frequently as hubs in the social prestige enhancing distribution of pirated media. It is particularly important in the light of the recent development of the distribution process from peer-to-peer online networks to offline forms of file swapping.

Temple University Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2015-22.\n|Abstract=Intellectual property law is caught in a widespread debate over whether it should serve incentive or natural rights objectives, and what the best means for achieving those ends are. This article reports a series of experiments revealing that these debates are actually orthogonal to how most users and many creators understand intellectual property law. The most common perception of intellectual property among the American public is that intellectual property law is designed to prevent plagiarism.\n\nThe plagiarism fallacy in intellectual property law is not an innocuous misperception. This fallacy likely helps explain pervasive illegal infringing activity on the Internet, common dismissal of copyright warnings, and other previously puzzling behavior. The received wisdom has been that the public is ethically dismissive or indifferent towards intellectual property rights. This research reveals instead that experts have failed to comprehend what the public’s conception of intellectual property law actually is.\n\nThe studies reported here uncover several additional intellectual property law findings, including that: (1) the majority of the American public views intellectual property rights as too broad and too strong, (2) knowledge of intellectual property law does not affect opinions about what the law should be, and (3) there are significant demographic and cultural divides concerning intellectual property rights. The findings as a whole raise central questions concerning the public legitimacy of intellectual property law, and consequently its ability to function as intended.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2588658\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2588658\n|Reference=Olson and Shaw (2011); Shaw and Olson (2014); Shaw, Li and Olson (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This survey presents an original series of experiments that reveal preventing plagiarism to be the leading perceived basis for intellectual property protection in the United States. It formulates a plagiarism fallacy theory through a series of three experiments concerning popular understandings and preferences for intellectual property rights. More specifically, it shows that: \n\n* There is a dominant focus on moral and ethical concerns with copying, but not legal concerns.\n\n* Preventing plagiarism is the most commonly selected objective, surpassing all traditionally identified objectives, including incentive, natural rights, and expressive alternatives.\n\n* Across a wide variety of subject matters and contexts, people tend to believe that simply providing proper attribution to the originator of a creative work or invention should enable the free copying of their work by others.\n\n* Americans have an extremely low level of knowledge about intellectual property law\n\n* Knowledge of intellectual property law does not affect individual opinions about what the law should be. \n\n* There are demographic and cultural divides concerning intellectual property law based upon peoples’ gender, age, income, and political identity.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Over 1700 U.S. adults took part in an experimental study designed to investigate popular conceptions of intellectual property rights.

Economic inquiry, 38(2), 159-174.\n|Abstract=Using data on software piracy, we examine how protection of intellectual property varies across countries. Consistent with other studies, we find that intellectual property receives greater protection in developed economies; high-income countries have lower piracy rates. We also find that protection depends on cultural factors. Countries with an individualist culture have lower piracy rates than do countries with a collectivist culture. Piracy rates are also lower in countries that have strong institutions that enforce contracts and protect property from expropriation. These results suggest that national policies towards intellectual property reflect not only economic concerns but also national culture and institutions.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2000.tb00011.x/abstract\n|Link=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupecinqu/v_3a38_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a159-74.htm\n|Reference=Hofstede (1980); Hofstede (1983); Ginarte and Park (1997); Rapp and Rozek (1990); Scalise (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Software piracy rates can be explained by a few economic, institutional, cultural variables. Countries with high per-capita income, a tradition of individualism, and/or strong institutions protecting contracts and property tend to have low piracy rates. Countries with high levels of education and high R&D intensity also have low piracy rates; however, these relationships are weak, at best, in regressions that account for economic development, culture , and institutional strength.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

First, they support the argument that intellectual property is a cultural phenomenon as well as an economic one. Countries with a collective culture- one that emphasizes sharing over individual ownership rights - have significantly higher piracy rates that do countries with an individualistic culture. Second, the results indicate the important link between economic institutions and intellectual property. Countries that protect contracts and traditional property also tend to be ones that protect intellectual property to software. Third, they indicate that the positive correlation between economic development and protection of intellectual property (i.e. low piracy rates) need not be casual. Although the exact relationship between economic development and intellectual property protection is unclear, it appears that much of the positive correlation can be explained by cultural and institutional factors that are correlated with economic development. \nTaken together these results suggest that efforts to reform intellectual property rights around the world must be sensitive to differences in cultural traditions and economic institutions, as well as differences in economic development.\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=The World Bank; Hofstede (1983); The Central Intelligence Agency (1995);\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Regression Analysis\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2024, 'title': 'Marshall (2004)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Marshall (2004)\n|Author=Marshall, L.\n|Title=The effects of piracy upon the music industry: a case study of bootlegging\n|Year=2004\n|Full Citation=Marshall, L. (2004). The effects of piracy upon the music industry: A case study of bootlegging. Media, Culture & Society, 26(2), 163-181.\n|Abstract="I don’t think the record company loses one cent on a bootleg. If they go after bootleggers, they’re wasting their money." (Max, a bootlegger, in Vettel, 1986)\n\nEach year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) releases a figure indicating the global value of pirated music. In 2000, this figure was $4.2 billion (IFPI, 2001). The IFPI argues that the actual losses suffered by the industry are not fully represented by this figure: ‘The value of the pirate market does not indicate losses in revenue to the legitimate recording industry, which are likely to be far greater’ (2001). These figures are then used in a strenuous lobbying campaign for the creation and enforcement of tougher copyright laws demanding, for example, restrictions on private copying exemptions, deterrent penalties and the dismantling of compulsory licensing provisions. This lobbying campaign is only likely to intensify in the future in response to online copying and the proliferation of CD burners. The IFPI, and its American equivalent, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) are skilful and powerful lobbyists, and past evidence suggests that policy-makers will continue to be influenced by their arguments.\n\nThe effects of piracy are, however, more difficult to ascertain. This is for three reasons. First, the word ‘piracy’ is a blanket term covering a wide variety of activities, including counterfeiting, pirating, bootlegging, home taping, tape trading and online file sharing. All of these areas of piracy have individual characteristics that make any attempt at synthesis a hazardous and, some might say, misleading venture. Second, the world of illegal recordings is not the easiest from which to gather data. As Jeremy Phillips writes: "Unfortunately, counterfeiters do not yet have to file annual returns to the Commission on the scale of their illegal activity, which means that the figures put forward for losses caused by counterfeiting are in danger of being subjective, hypothetical and methodologically flawed. (1999: 275)"\n\nPiracy figures are often used for their rhetorical impact rather than as a reflection of reality. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, recording industry statistics do not take into account the variety of different meanings and uses that pirated music takes in the day-to-day lives of many people. Music plays an important role in the creation of meaning in many people’s lives, and the industry’s concern with questions of supply (who owns these recordings?) has neglected important questions of demand (why do people want them?) (Frith, 2002). This results in a distorted impression of the effects of piracy. For example, music industry representatives lobbying for a levy on blank audio tape in the early 1980s (and again for blank digital audio tape later in the decade) argued that every blank tape sold resulted in one less official sale (Frith, 1987: 59). The small amount of non-industry sponsored research conducted into the area, however, indicates that people often use blank tapes in non-displacing activities (for example, Brown et al., 2001; Cohen, 1990).\n\nThis article looks at one area of piracy – bootlegging – and discusses its possible effects upon the official industry. It begins by briefly differentiating bootlegging from other forms of piracy, and then provides an overview of the scale of bootlegging and the type of music fans who buy bootlegs. Following this, it discusses the possible effects of bootlegging upon the official industry. Bootlegging is a highly idiosyncratic area of piracy and the discussions here cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spheres. However, the overall purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further research into the meanings of music piracy across a wide variety of settings in order to obtain a more realistic impression of the scale and effects of piracy in the music industry.\n|Authentic Link=http://mcs.sagepub.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/\n|Link=http://www.academia.edu/1935331/The_effects_of_piracy_upon_the_music_industry_A_case_study_of_bootlegging\n|Reference=Fiske (1992); Frith (2002); Kretschmer, Klimis and Wallis (2001); Heylin (1994);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main propositions and arguments of the study: \n\n*Bootlegging has always been a small-scale activity: following the closure of legal loopholes, a regular pressing of a bootleg title is about 500 copies worldwide. A very successful bootleg would then go to a second pressing of another 500 copies, but this is rare. Anything in the region of 3,000 sales would be considered enormous in bootlegging circles.\n\n*Given that a release by a major label has to sell around 300,000 copies just to break even, the greatest successes of the bootleggers would still rank among the most dismal of failures for the mainstream industry.\n\n*The people who buy bootlegs are extremely committed fans who use bootlegs as a way of maintaining an ongoing, meaningful relationship with their favoured artists or bands. \n\n*The recording industry argues that bootlegs detract from officially released record sales: but the collector’s interest in the unofficial recordings of an artist generally stems from an extensive knowledge of their official canon, and thus the majority of bootleg buyers will own all the official releases of their artist(s) before even beginning to buy bootlegs. \n\n*This loyalty has often been exploited by the record labels: through box sets, unreleased recordings, multiple great hits and singles collections etc. \n\n*The recording industry argues that recording artists and songwriters do not obtain any royalty payments from the sale of a bootleg: the majority of bootlegs are of live performances and these tend to involve someone smuggling a recording device into the venue and recording the show. If this is so, then the artist (and his record label) has received payment for that performance in the shape of ticket sales (not including the revenue generated from sales of concert souvenirs such as T-shirts). The artist (and her record label) have in fact received significant income from the performance that features on a bootleg.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Music is a commodity that requires legal protection, but the meanings given to that commodity are not merely the ones set out by those who produce it.\n|Description of Data=The author refers to interviews and email correspondence with bootleggers, but does not disclose any details of how many interview/correspondence subjects took part, whether the interviews were face to face or over the phone, or how long they lasted.

After controlling for an autoregressive component and a declining time trend in sales, the file-sharing elasticity of sales is not statistically different from zero in the difference GMM estimations.

Moreover, the results suggest an upper bound of −0.21 of elasticity, indicating that the short-term sales displacement effect is moderate at worst.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11066-014-9085-0\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742443 ; http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228294444_Does_file-sharing_reduce_DVD_sales\n|Reference=Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Zentner (2005); Bhattacharjee, Gopal, Lertwachara, Marsden and Telang (2007); Mckenzie (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*There are some differences between the popularity of movies on sales charts and on BitTorrent.

Nature and Scope of exclusive rights (hyperlinking/browsing; reproduction right),\n|Discipline=L82: Entertainment • Media, L86: Information and Internet Services • Computer Software\n|Intervention-Response=File-sharing is related to the well-studied problem of optimal degree of intellectual property protection. At the heart of the problem is the trade-off between social welfare and incentives to create. Creating is costly, while the marginal cost of producing a digital copy from the original is zero. Without considering the incentives of creators and with zero marginal cost, social welfare would be maximized by allowing the product to be copied freely. However, if incentives to create are hampered due to piracy, there are no creative products to consume. In a dynamic setting, when incentives are considered, piracy can thus result in a welfare loss. However, piracy affects incentives to create through reduced revenue only if consumers who would have otherwise\nbought a legal product acquire an illegal copy, that is, if piracy substitutes sales. \n\nFrom the creator’s perspective the consequences of copying and thus incentives to create depend on the “market harm” of copying: the way in which the availability of unauthorized copies substitutes sales and decreases revenue. The concept of market harm is crucial from legal perspective as well.It is exactly the estimation of the “harmfulness of use” which is the main focus of this paper.\n|Description of Data=To study the short-term effect of movie downloads on DVD sales, data on weekly DVD sales and movie torrent downloads in the USA during a 13-week period from March 2 to May 31, 2009 is used.\n|Data Year=March 2 to May 31, 2009\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=Mininova; Nash Information Services;\n|Method of Collection=Web analytic (online user trace data)\n|Method of Analysis=Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Film and motion pictures;\n|Country=USA;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None stated;\n|Level of Aggregation=Genre; movies;\n|Data Material Year=2014\n|Sample Size=461 movie-weeks\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=478\n|Level of Aggregation=DVD sales,\n|Data Material Year=2009\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1529, 'title': 'Marvasti (2000)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Marvasti (2000)\n|Author=A.

In the motion picture industry, economies of scale and imperfect competition, in addition to cultural sovereignty, are conditions sometimes used to justify protectionist policies. This paper examines the significance of the capital-labor ratio,VCRs, market share, tariffs, domestic market size, taste similarities, stars and domestically\npopular films on international trade in the industry. The results indicate that stars and\nblockbusters in the domestic market do not seem to influence consumption of films overseas,\nhowever, external economies of scale are present in the industry, tariffs are effective trade\nbarriers in the industry, and VCRs increase the chances of piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13571510084087#.VcRhj_lViko\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/24081529_Motion_Pictures_Industry_Economies_of_Scale_and_Trade\n|Reference=Wallace et al (1993); Chung and Cox (1994); Prag and Cassavant (1994); Canterbery and Marvasti (1994);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Estimates of the net export and intra-industry trade measure equations support the factor endowment theory of trade. However, the industry appears to be labor-rather than capital-intensive. Furthermore, the effect of the degree of concentration in the industry is inconclusive. External economies of scale for trade in motion pictures receives some support consistent with the findings by Marvasti (1994). It also appears that the alleviation of the US tariffs on the imports of motion pictures in the last three decades has contributed to the narrowing gap between exports and imports in the industry. Surprisingly, while the `blockbuster’ is a significant contributor to domestic production in the US motion pictures industry, it does not seem to be a significant determinant of trade in the industry.\n\nThe large size of the domestic market appears to be important for supporting expensive stars and blockbusters as well as an excess supply of films for the global market. Yet, stars and\nblockbusters in the domestic market do not seem to have a positive effect on the US exports of motion pictures, possibly because of differing taste driven by cultural differences. It must be noted, however, that changes in the foreign direct investment in the industry may have influenced the results and possibly distorted our judgement with regard to the determinants of trade in motion pictures industry.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Dimensions of P2P and digital piracy in a university campus.\n|Abstract=This article presents findings from the first large-scale quantitative assessment of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) exchanges of copyrighted material on a college campus based on actual observation. Through passive monitoring and deep packet inspection (DPI), we assess the extent to which P2P is used to transfer copyrighted material. We also characterize the demographics of P2P users, the relative popularity of the material, and how the burden on the campus network varies over time. We found that at least 51% of students living on campus engaged in P2P, at least 42% attempted to transfer copyrighted material, and the mean number of copyrighted media titles whose transfer is attempted per week was at least 6 per monitored student. Some students use P2P legally, e.g. to transfer Linux software or non-copyrighted adult material, but we found no evidence that large numbers of students use P2P for these legal purposes and not to transfer copyrighted material. Students of all genders, ages, classes and majors engaged in file sharing, to the extent that demographics were not helpful in identifying likely file-sharers so as to target interventions. This study also provides lessons for those who would use DPI technology to reduce illegal use of P2P. If given enough weeks to observe, current technology is effective at identifying users who attempt to transfer copyrighted material, provided that their traffic is identifiable as P2P. Thus, DPI can be used to estimate the extent of piracy, and to notify individuals who may be violating copyright law. However, encryption is available and can be easily activated in most P2P clients. Once turned on, encryption prevents DPI from detecting whether transferred material is copyrighted, rendering it ineffective. If DPI is used for copyright enforcement that includes imposition of penalties, then P2P users or P2P developers may have the incentive to use encryption as a way of evading detection.\n|Authentic Link=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&context=epp\n|Reference=Collins and Reiter (2006); Liebowitz (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The study detected P2P activity by about half of the students living on campus (51%) and the great majority of those (42%) were also detected transferring or attempting to transfer copyrighted material. \n* During the monitored period, the average number of copyrighted media titles detected being transferred per student was 18. Out of the students found transferring or attempting to transfer copyrighted material, 70% were detected attempting more than one copyrighted title per day.\n* Demographics were poor predictors of whether or how much students engage in P2P or in transfers of copyrighted material. This implies that demographics are ineffective for targeting interventions, such as education campaigns, that aim at altering students’ behavior. Even so, the average number of titles per week decreases for older students or student s closer to graduation. \n* File sharing occurred at all times of the day and night, peaking on weeknights when people are typically not using their computers. \n* The study provides useful lessons on use of DPI technology to reduce illegal activities, as results indicate today’s technology is effective in detecting users that transfer copyrighted material using unencrypted P2P.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

One disadvantage is that some P2P transfers are legal and beneficial, and such a policy would prohibit security practices that protect these legal transfers as well as their illegal counterparts.\n|Description of Data=Data was taken from the Digital Citizen Project undertaken by Illinois State University.

M., & Peha, J. M. (2011, September). Quantifying Global Transfers of Copyrighted Content using BitTorrent. TPRC.\n|Abstract=This paper presents the most accurate empirical study to date to characterize and quantify the amount of content of various types that is transferred worldwide using BitTorrent, the dominant peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application. Using data we collected from the largest public BitTorrent tracker over 106 days between August 2010 and February 2011 and a new methodology, we find that for some content types, the number of copies transferred is an order of magnitude greater than the number sold through legal channels. For example, we estimate that 10.7 songs were transferred using BitTorrent for every song sold, 3.6 movies were transferred using BitTorrent for every legal sale or rental of a DVD or Blu-ray, and 227 movies were transferred using BitTorrent for every paid download. We also find that the vast majority of music and video content transferred using BitTorrent is copyrighted, as demonstrated both by the swarm metadata we observed, and the fact that only 0.55% of the transfers were of files indexed by websites that specialize in content that can be transferred legally.\nThis article assesses what and how much content is transferred using BitTorrent, currently the most popular file sharing P2P protocol in use, with the purpose of fulfilling three objectives. The first objective is to provide a reasonable empirically derived lower bound for the number of copies of copyrighted titles transferred using BitTorrent.  The second objective is to break that lower bound down into categories depending on characteristics of\ncontent transferred.  The third objective is to understand which content formats and technical characteristics of content (different methods of video digitalization, video resolutions and audio bit rates) users prefer.\n|Authentic Link=http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~peha/quantifying_global_P2P.pdf\n|Link=http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~peha/quantifying_global_P2P.pdf\n|Reference=Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2009); Layton and Watters (2010); Envisional (2011); Sandvine (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* BitTorrent transfers result in hundreds of millions of copyright violations worldwide per day, and that copyright holders fail to realize significant revenues as a result. \n* Movies are the type of content most supplied and most transferred in BitTorrent (shared in 38.7% of swarms and accounting for 26.1% of transfers). Songs and software, despite being shared in small percentages of swarms (4.5% and 7.2% of swarms respectively), rank 2nd and 3rd in terms of transfers (with 20.4% and 16.8% of transfers respectively).\n* This demonstrates limitations of past studies that estimated the economic impact of P2P by looking at which content is available rather than trying to measure the number of actual transfers. Surprisingly, most of the copies transferred using BitTorrent come from a small number of extremely popular titles; 37 song titles account for half of all songs transferred, and 117 movies account half of all movie transfers. Thus, for a global marketplace, the importance of the “long tail” of less popular content is smaller than we and others have observed in more localized studies. In general, the content that is popular in legal channels is also popular with BitTorrent, but we observe some important differences. For example, we find that content that is popular among teenagers is more likely to be disproportionally represented in BitTorrent transfers as compared to content that appeals to an older audience.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2014). Disclosing Big Data. Minn. L. Rev., 99, 535.\n|Abstract=This Article reveals that the law is failing to adequately encourage producers of “big data” to disclose their most innovative work to the public. “Big data” refers to a new industrial and scientific phenomenon that holds the potential to transform diverse industries — from medicine, to energy, to online services. At the heart of this phenomenon are innovative and complex practices by which experts shape featureless digital records into valuable information products. The fact that these big data practices are unlikely to be disclosed to the public is worrisome for familiar reasons: the law generally prefers to induce technological disclosure in order to serve the goal of promoting progress. Beyond this general concern, the nondisclosure of big data practices threatens innovation in unique ways that are particularly insidious. The cause of this problem, and possibly its resolution, lies in the interplay between big data and intellectual property law — a nexus that scholars have not explored until now.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/\n|Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2358985\n|Reference=Tene and Polonetsky (2013); Lemley (2008); Peer (2014); Madison (2014);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study:\n\n*Big data practices do not fit neatly into the traditional intellectual property paradigms of patent or copyright. \n\n*Existing intellectual property policy does little to meaningfully encourage the disclosure of big data practices. \n\n*A variety of forces, both legal and economic, are powerfully pushing data producers toward nondisclosure.\n\n*Big data practices are highly subjective, and difficult to uncover through reverse engineering. As a result, big data practices lend themselves toward secrecy. \n\n*Findings varied across different types of big data practices: filtering non-relevant data (i.e., "noise") from large datasets; identifying and correcting errors based on estimates or guesses; "masking" data in order to preserve the anonymity of individuals; and classifying data.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

There may be many ways to further this goal, such as new rulemaking within federal agencies, or perhaps a legislative change to intellectual property law. \n\n*This article explores the latter possibility by presenting a dataright as an exploratory device. By offering big data producers something new and valuable-an exclusive right to limit downstream use of their data-this new intellectual property right could encourage valuable technological disclosures that would otherwise remain shrouded in secrecy. \n\n*This solution would carry substantial drawbacks however: it would encourage disclosure only in settings where data producers value data exclusivity more than they value secrecy in their methods. Moreover, this solution would entail significant new costs. Whether these costs would be outweighed by the plan\'s benefits would be a productive starting point for future discussion.\n\n*In light of big data\'s growing economic and social importance, policymakers and the public should be concerned with how the legal system will influence the production and use of this valuable new resource. Currently, the intellectual property system is not well configured to meet its goal of encouraging technological disclosures in this new frontier.\n|Description of Data=This study draws on a set of interviews and surveys that the author conducted with informaticists, data scientists, lawyers, and business professionals working in big data across different industries. \nThe author assembled a listing of all big data companies, initiatives, and projects described in national newspapers, books, journals, and online press published since 2009. The author interviewed individuals at these organizations by telephone. All interviews lasted at least forty-five minutes, and some lasted hours.

Copyright‐related\nactivity therefore has to be recognised as an important factor of economic\ndevelopment around the world but also and particularly in emerging economies and\ndeveloping countries.\nThe objectives of the Report are basically threefold: (i) The Report aims at making\naccessible a large body of competition law practice around the world as guidance for\ncompetition law enforcers in other jurisdictions. (ii) It also tries to promote general\nknowledge and understanding of how competition law should be applied to\ncopyright‐related markets. (iii) The Report is also meant to provide benefits for\ninternational copyright policy. With its market‐oriented analysis, competition law can\nprovide new insights on how markets for authorised use.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.ip.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Report_Copyright-Competition-Development_December-2013.pdf\n|Link=http://www.ip.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Report_Copyright-Competition-Development_December-2013.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=* First, the survey has produced an amazingly large body of experience of many competition law jurisdictions around the world on copyright‐related markets from which other jurisdictions can benefit enormously. In particular, it is to be noted that especially in the larger emerging economies, which also represent younger competition law jurisdictions, practice on copyright‐related markets has virtually exploded during the last very few years.\n\n* Second, the Report also highlights the importance of media and entertainment markets for technological development in many countries.\n\n* Third, the Report also highlights the importance of competition law for the free flow of information and thereby can contribute significantly to the development of democracy in individual countries.\n\n* Finally, it is hoped that the Report can provide incentives for the future work agenda of\nWIPO. In particular, the survey has produced a major need and interest of the agencies of\nespecially younger and smaller competition law jurisdictions in building up competence and\nunderstanding of the challenges of copyright‐related markets.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

In addition, many contact persons, most at local universities, provided additional insights by answering the Questionnaire. The agencies of more experienced competition jurisdictions, where access to decisions is not a problem, did not receive the Questionnaire.  This Report refrains from specifying which country‐specific information contained within it is\nmore or less reliable. In any instance, due to the need to limit its volume, the Report can\nonly present a selection of interesting and valuable cases.

The technology, although, in its early stages has already raised questions pertaining to intellectual property (IP) implications. This paper considers the IP implications of 3D printing. In particular the paper considers the challenges to patent law, trademark law, copyright law and design law as a result of this emerging technology. The paper also questions whether lessons can be learned from the entertainment industry and the manner in which this industry has attempted to deal with online piracy. The paper suggests that rather than focusing on stringent IP laws, the future in dealing with emerging technologies which challenges IP laws lie in adopting new business models in adapting to technologies such as 3D printing.\n|Authentic Link=http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/journal-article/150294\n|Reference=Brown and Taylor (2012); Markillie (2012); Bradshaw et al. (2010); Barraclough (2011); Cornish et al. (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*  It is important to "adapt" to 3D printing and "adopt" new business models rather than focus merely on the law\n\n* IP implications of 3D printing are far from clear. While 3D printing a product may not infringe one element of IP law, it is quite possible that it will breach another type of IP. To complicate matters, the above assessment also revealed that the same branch of IP can lead to both infringement and non-infringement of protected products which are 3D printed. For example, while under s.10 of TMA 1994, it will be an infringement to print a product protected by a trade mark, s.11(2) states that if labelled correctly, infringement can be avoided\n\n* Similar to online platforms such as Napster, Grokster, Pirate Bay and Megaupload which facilitated and induced online infringement of copyright, it is quite possible that new online platforms such as Thingiverse, Shapeways, Cubify and Quirky will facilitate 3D printing of products—which are protected by IP laws—in time to come. However, unlike MP3 files and video copying which produced perfect copies, the same will not be true for 3D printing. \n\n* The material that will be needed to carry out 3D printing, could prove to be a challenge, but this could be an opportunity for the start-up of new businesses and business ventures specialising in raw materials which will be needed for 3D printing. At present prices vary from €30 to €218 depending on the amount of raw material needed\n\n* It is difficult to compete with free —i.e. pirated and counterfeit content which is available online for free\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The drawback of this model is the risk of creating a monopoly. The entertainment industry welcomed Apple’s iTunes business model when it was launched and was in fact reluctant to license to anyone else. Now, with Apple having the upper hand or the monopoly, the entertainment industry is in constant negotiation with Apple regarding their pricing strategy. The stakeholder most likely to lose out from such negotiations is the artist. In the present context, it could be the manufacturer who could be losing out. Bearing in mind the above drawback, maybe a better option would be to license 3D files more widely\n\n* On a more practical level, stores should consider having a physical presence and an online presence with a 3D arm attached to the online store as well—where 3D designs can be sold for a competitive price. \n\n* It is hoped that the law will not stifle 3D printing\n\n* The time will come when significant decisions will need to be made. At that time, one option will be to follow in the footsteps of the entertainment industry and shy away from the technology, thereby enforcing stricter intellectual property laws; or be more creative by adapting to the emerging 3D technology by adopting new business models. In learning valuable lessons from the entertainment industry’s experience, the hope is that the latter option will be chosen.\n|Description of Data=The author reviews the IP regimes and their application to 3D printing\n|Data Year=Non stated\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=Legislative review; Literature review;\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Case Study\n|Method of Analysis=Qualitative Analysis Methods\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment; Specialised design;\n|Country=United Kingdom;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=Yes\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=4\n|Level of Aggregation=Legal regime,\n|Data Material Year=Non stated\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

Still, most of these studies do not examine (at the household level) whether consumers substituted out of music and into movies. This paper uses micro-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (1998 through 2003) to test for this possible substitution effect. The data does not support the hypothesis that music consumers spent less on music because they spent more on either movie tickets or prerecorded movies (purchases or rentals).\n|Authentic Link=http://www.serci.org/rerci.html#Vol2No2\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1145842\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2004); Hong 2004; Michel (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study provided an extrapolation of prior studies carried out by the author (2005) and Hong (2004) which found that the use of file sharing software had a negative impact on legitimate music sales.

Control measures are taken to ensure that the CSX data is representative of the U.S population. The number of consumers used to complete the survey is unknown. Rather than use a simple random sample, the CEX data is collected based on a stratified sample design whereby two sampling units exist per stratum.

This paper uses micro-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey to examine the impact of Internet file sharing on music sales. Music industry representatives argue that the practice decreases CD sales, while supporters of file-sharing allege the practice could actually increase sales. Using household-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we find support for the claim that file-sharing has decreased sales.\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4908465_The_Impact_of_Digital_File_Sharing_on_the_Music_Industry_An_Empirical_Analysis\n|Reference=Zentner (2005); Hong (2004); Liebowitz (2004a); Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004); Rob and Waldfogel (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Our micro-level data test results suggest that file sharing may have reduced album sales (between 1999 and 2003) by as much as 13 percent for some music consumers. At minimum, our test results indicate that the relationship between computer ownership and music purchases (in the CEX) weakened after Internet file sharing became a viable option for music purchasers. No similar negative change exists in the data prior to the initiation of the first file-sharing service. Furthermore, we present evidence that this weakened relationship is concentrated among the heaviest music purchasers, and we find no evidence that file sharing led to a widespread increase in music purchases. Nonetheless, our results should be used carefully when predicting the long-term viability of the music industry in an environment where record labels (or artists) compete directly with free file-sharing services. In the current market, most music consumers purchase their music in the CD format, and digital downloads are not as highly substitutable for CDs as for other digital downloads.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, we hypothesize that knowledge of software piracy promoted by these campaigns will lead to increased awareness of the legal consequences of engaging in software piracy and the likelihood of being punished. These two constructs, in turn, will impact on one’s attitude towards software piracy, and hence, on the level of one’s pirating behavior. We test the model using a sample of U.S. business students and find strong support for the model, with an understanding of the number of jobs lost due to software piracy being the dominant factor. This suggests that decision makers in the software industry need to refocus educational outreach programs from stressing the illegality of copyright infringement to emphasizing the social consequences of such behavior.\n|Authentic Link=http://crawl.prod.proquest.com.s3.amazonaws.com/fpcache/91e13cc8ee6e644fcb62482b3008bd5a.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJF7V7KNV2KKY2NUQ&Expires=1440253504&Signature=PX2rwuhWDc3YcCrYjrNwdrnOHKI%3D\n|Link=http://crawl.prod.proquest.com.s3.amazonaws.com/fpcache/91e13cc8ee6e644fcb62482b3008bd5a.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJF7V7KNV2KKY2NUQ&Expires=1440253504&Signature=PX2rwuhWDc3YcCrYjrNwdrnOHKI%3D\n|Reference=Ajzen (1991); Moores and Chang (2006); Moores and Dhaliwal (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article aims at empirically examining the question of whether people stop engaging in software piracy when they understand that software piracy is a crime and has harmful social and economic consequences.

If worries over offshoring and the loss of entry-level positions has impacted on the psyche of business students, persuading someone not to pirate software because it may impact on their future job prospects is likely to be a powerful message.\n\n- The authors do not suggest that further aggressive legislation is warranted; rather, it would appear the message has gotten through and further education on the existing laws may be the most effective next step.\n\n- Anti-piracy campaigns using movie stars, pop singers, or sports stars would acquire the power of the voice of the advocate.\n|Description of Data=Dataset comprises 103 completed questionnaires, answered by business students at a large southwestern U.S. university.\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)\n|Method of Analysis=Correlation and Association, Structural Equation Modeling, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games); Programming and broadcasting; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=USA;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=103\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1948, 'title': 'Montoro-Pons and Cuadrado-García (2006)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Dataset=\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Montoro-Pons and Cuadrado-García (2006)\n|Author=Montoro-Pons, J.

"Digital goods and the effects of copying: an empirical study of the music market." 14th International Conference on Cultural Economics, Vienna. 2006.\n|Abstract=Digital goods, streams of information stored in bits with economic value, have\ntransformed the way many economic agents interact in markets and specially those in\nthe cultural sector. The non-rival nature of its consumption has had a significant impact\nin different industries, specially the music industry: record labels have witnessed in the\nlast decade a proliferation of the means to circumvent copyright in protected materials.\nThis paper aims at assessing the impact of piracy on legal demand. Unlike previous\nstudies we address the issue from a wider perspective, considering both physical and\nonline piracy. Our findings show that there is a substitution effect between copies and\noriginals, and that there is no significant positive effect of piracy on legal demand,\nwhich rules out the possibility of network effects or sampling effects much discussed\nin the literature on piracy. Moreover we find that lost sales amount to a 131% of the\nlegal market on the average, even though there is a wide variation between countries.\n|Link=http://www.fokus.or.at/fileadmin/fokus/user/downloads/acei_paper/Pons.pdf\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

Journal of Computer Information Systems, 51(3), 1.\n|Abstract=We examine the role of age, gender, and work experience on the propensity to buy, share, and use pirated software. These demographics are key properties of the cognitive-developmental, gender socialization, and occupational socialization theories. We find the overall level of reported buying is low, while the level of sharing and use is high. From the perspective of socialization, we find differences in levels of buying based on gender, differences in levels of sharing based on age and gender, and differences in levels of use based on years of work experience. This suggests the source of pirated software has shifted from buying to a diffusion network that involves sharing within certain social groups. The higher rate of use for those with more years of work experience reinforces a continual problem for software vendors: The inability of customers to pay for software that is deemed necessary to conduct business.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.iacis.org/jcis/jcis_toc.php?volume=51&issue=3\n|Link=http://www.iacis.org/jcis/jcis_toc.php?volume=51&issue=3\n|Reference=Siponen and Vartiainen 2004; Moores, Nill and Rothenberger (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Usage levels of pirated software remain high. There has been a shift in acquisition behaviour with users predominantly downloading and sharing pirated software rather than buying pirate discs in-store.  Pirated software is shared through a diffusion network of family, friends, and colleagues that requires fewer purchases of pirate discs and is maintained principally by female members. The study provides a better sociological understanding of piracy behaviour and a person's propensity to engage in software piracy as follows:\n\n*  Sharing pirated software has twice the impact of buying, in that the diffusion of pirated software amongst a social group is less dependant on the purchase of a pirate disc and more upon the acquisition of a copy through friends, colleagues or peer to peer networks;\n\n* No form of socialisation (age, gender or work experience) can account for a propensity to engage in buying, sharing and using pirated software. Significant correlations are found relative to each single category however;\n\n* Younger people are more likely to share pirated software than older people; \n\n* Males tend to be the initiators (buyers) and females are the facilitators (sharers) of the software piracy diffusion network;\n\n* Number of years of work experience is the only socialisation variable to detect a difference in using pirate software. People with more work experience are more likely to use pirate software.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

It is sensible to continue the policy of raids on companies thought to be using pirated software as well as policing shops and online stores. Controlling software piracy will be most effective by conducting a campaign that raises the awareness of the illegality of software piracy and persuades individuals that software piracy is wrong. Anti piracy campaigners need to adapt to the new market model presented by this study and take account of underlying socio-cultural forces if levels of piracy are to be reduced. Because the piracy market may support the legal market by allowing users to 'try out' software, developers could release feature-restricted, trial versions of their software for certain markets which may reduce the rate of sharing illegal copies amongst users.\n|Description of Data=This study uses primary data collected from a questionnaire survey completed by a target sample of students taking a Masters course in information management, engineering and administration at a university in Thailand.The sample comprised 213 usable responses that contained  a demographic distribution of 119 males, 94 females, an average age of 27.4, and an average of 3.7 years of work experience. Over 94% own a computer, with an average of 10.6 years of computer use. Participants were asked to evaluate how much they bought, shared, and used pirated software (defined in terms of frequency of behaviour).

Untangling the Web of Relationships between Wealth, Culture, and Global Software Piracy Rates: A Path Model. International Comparisons of Information Communication Technologies: Advancing Applications: Advancing Applications : 110.\n|Abstract=This article examines the relationship between Hofstede’s national culture indices (IDV, PSI, MAS, and UAI), economic wealth (GNI), and national software piracy rates (SPR). Although a number of studies have already examined this relationship, the contribution of this article is two-fold. First, we develop a path model that highlights not only the key factors that promote software piracy, but also the inter-relationships between these factors. Second, most studies have used the dataset from the pre-2003 methodology which only accounted for business software and did not take into account local market conditions. Using the latest dataset and a large sample of countries (n=61) we find there is an important triadic relationship between PDI, IDV, and GNI that explains over 80% of the variance in software piracy rates. Implications for combating software piracy are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.igi-global.com/article/untangling-web-relationships-between-wealth/39016\n|Reference=Hofstede and Hofstede (2005); BSA (2003); World Bank (2008); Bae and Choi (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article seeks to explain the differing software piracy rates, especially amongst economically developed countries by examining culture and other correlated factors.  Hofstede's four factor cultural model measures PDI (power distance index, the accepted societal the power gap), masculinity-feminity (MAS), uncertainty avoidance index (UAI), and IDV (individual-collectivism) are examined to determine if and how culture influences in for higher software piracy rates.  Even taking all into account, low GDP is still the most predictive factor in software piracy, which is significantly and positively correlated with IDV and PDI. However, culture and wealth are interrelated and pose complicated challenges to reducing software piracy rates.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The model developed here suggests that as people become richer, they become more individualistic, and the combination of these two effects result in the tendency to buy legal, rather than pirated copies of software, even in countries that traditionally have high software piracy rates.\n\nFurthermore, while vendor organizations such as the BSA and SIIA have a role to play in highlighting and attempting to combat software piracy, the model produced here accounts for more than 80% of the variance, and so, there seems little variance left over to attribute to the efforts of these organizations.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Criminological theory in the digital age: The case of social learning theory and digital piracy. Journal of Criminal Justice, 38(4), 470-480.\n|Abstract=To date, few studies had attempted to extend existing theories of crime to technology driven crimes, such as digital piracy. To address this gap in the literature, this study explored the ability of Akers’ social learning theory in explaining the likelihood of engaging in digital piracy. Also explored was the extent to which the social learning process mediated the impact of several noteworthy correlates of digital piracy among college students attending different universities (n=585), relying on a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. The findings were modestly supportive of social learning theory as it may apply to digital piracy. The findings are discussed in the context of extending existing theories of crime to account for contemporary technology driven crimes, such as digital piracy. Policy implications and direction for future research are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235210000711\n|Reference=Akers (1985); Akers (1988); Piquero (2005); Holt (2007); Morris and Higgins (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- The results suggest that social learning theory may account for a substantial amount of variation in the likelihood to engage in digital piracy. That is, individuals are likely to follow the social learning process that will lead them to digital piracy. The results also indicate that consistent correlates of digital piracy (e.g., gender and age) are mediated by social learning theory. By exploring crimes similar to digital piracy, scholars can shed light on existing theories, such as, but not limited to social learning theory.\n\n- Scholars, and the society that they serve, have much to gain by giving attention to digital crimes. Through studying digital piracy, one can gain a better understanding of crime that takes place from behind a computer terminal. This allows for theories to be critiqued, reevaluated and modified.\n\n- Studying digital piracy is unique by the fact that it can be used as a strategic site for unveiling criminological concepts like social learning theory as they may apply to digital crimes. Accounting for differences in how a particular theory can explain terrestrial crimes versus digital crimes may have major implications for future theory and policy development.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Educational efforts need to take place offline as well as on-line and should be delivered technology users starting at a very early age. Initiatives geared toward educating youngsters about the benefits, dangers, and morals of participating in the on-line world could be easily developed and implemented at the primary-school level. These recommendations are consistent with N.L. Piquero's (2005) suggestion that education is an effective strategy to reduce instances of digital piracy (i.e., intellectual property theft).\n|Description of Data=The data for the present study were collected during the Fall 2006 semester, from two universities in the United States.

In this paper we explore the possibility that broad, illegitimate distribution of a digital good might have offsetting effects on the demand for complementary non-digital goods. We examine the impact of file-sharing on sales of recorded music and on the demand for live concert performances. We provide evidence suggesting that while file-sharing reduced album sales, it simultaneously increased demand for concerts. This effect is most pronounced for small artists, perhaps because file-sharing boosts awareness of such artists. The impact of file-sharing on large, well-known artists’ live performances is negligible.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762451200008X\n|Reference=Teece (1986); Blackburn (2004); Zentner (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2007); Hong(2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* As with the earlier literature, the study finds that sales of recorded music declined precipitously with the entry of Napster and large-scale file-sharing. \n\n* The evidence is consistent with illegitimate redistribution of digital goods increasing revenue from non-digital complementary products. While file-sharing may have substantially displaced album sales, it also facilitated a broader distribution of music, which appears to have expanded awareness of smaller artists and increased demand for their live concert performances. \n\n* Concert revenues for large artists, however, appear to have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. Music for large artists was likely widely available prior to file-sharing, and as a result it is not surprising that demand for those artists’ concerts would have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. \n\n* The decline in album sales is much more pronounced for large artists than for small artists. Large artists’ music may have been more readily available on file-sharing sites, in which case file-sharing would naturally have a bigger impact on large artists. But for small artists, file-sharing may have increased awareness of their music and encouraged some additional album sales from a larger fan base even as it displaced album sales to others. \n\n* While the market for live music appears to expand after Napster, and the market for recorded music contracts, the results imply that large artists lose market share in both markets.\n\n* Given the sharp changes observed over a very short period of time around the entry of Napster, along with the differences in the effects for large vs. small artists, the findings in this paper are more easily explained by file-sharing than by other contemporaneous factors.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

These data describe 227,230 concert events performed by 12,356 artists in the period 1993–2004. For concerts performed between 1993–2002, the data provide detailed box office information, including tickets sold, total ticket revenues, and high and low ticket prices. For 2003 and 2004, the study observes the dates, locations (city and venue name), and identities of all performing bands, but does not have data on box office receipts.\n\n* Data on album sales come from Nielsen SoundScan, a company that tracks music sales at the point of sale. Some of the results reported are based on aggregate sales by designated market area (DMA), covering the years 1993–2002. The study observes data for a subsample of 1,806 artists matched to the concert data from Pollstar. These artists are referred to as a  “matched sample”.\n\n* Additional data on recorded music for individual albums from MusicBrainz, an online database that tracks detailed album information for official album releases for the purpose of documenting or “tagging” downloaded music tracks.\n\n* In addition to the detailed data on concerts and recorded music, a number of characteristics about artists and recorded releases are collected from several other sources. These include: artist characteristics from allmusic.com’s online database of artists, and data from Recorded Industry Association of America (RIAA) to measure cumulative album sales prior to 1993 for artists that were established before that date. The study also uses data from BigChampagne (collected during 2007) to measure a cross-section of downloading activity across artists and cities.\n|Data Year=1993-2004; 2007\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=Pollstar; Nielsen SoundScan; RIAA; MusicBrainz; BigChampagne;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Quantitative data/text mining, Longitudinal Study\n|Method of Analysis=Correlation and Association, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=USA;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=None;\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1350, 'title': 'Morton and Koufteros (2008)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Morton and Koufteros (2008)\n|Author=Morton, N.

The music industry has suffered significant financial losses and has responded with lawsuits, although online music piracy remains prevalent. This article developed a research model to study the determinants of individual intentions to commit online music piracy. The model was derived from the theories of planned behavior and deterrence. A survey questionnaire of 216 respondents was used to test the model. Consistent with the theory of planned behavior, the results showed that attitude toward online music piracy, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant antecedent factors of intention to commit online music piracy. Concerning deterrence theory, the results suggest that the effect of perceived punishment severity on attitude was highly significant for females, and the effect of perceived certainty of punishment on attitude was not significant for males or females.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10705510802154331\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/233175076_Intention_to_Commit_Online_Music_Piracy_and_Its_Antecedents_An_Empirical_Investigation\n|Reference=Gopal and Sanders (2000); Easley, Michel and Devaraj (2003); Battacharjee, Gopal, and Sanders (2003); Kwong, Oliver, Jenny, Leo, and Alan (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Hypothesis:\n* The authors tested the 8 hypothesis on what (like perceived likelyhood of punishment) affects intentions to commit online piracy and attitude toward online piracy.\nResults suggest:\n* The perceived severity of punishment for females may have a significant influence on attitudes irrespective of the perceived certainty of punishment.\n* That the threat of punishment might not be all that effective in deterring online music piracy, particularly for males.\n* That individuals’ intentions to commit online music piracy are influenced by their attitudes toward the behavior and their perceptions of the extent to which those that are important to them would approve of the behavior\n* That perceived certainty of punishment, on the other hand, is not a significant antecedent to attitudes toward the behavior for either males or females\n* Findings indicate that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant antecedents to intention to commit online music piracy. \n* This study also indicates that the perceived severity of punishment for engaging in online music piracy is a significant antecedent to attitudes toward the behavior for females, but not for males. The perceived certainty of punishment, on the other hand, is not a significant antecedent to attitudes toward the behavior for either gender. \n* The study provides additional support for the TPB in the context of ethical behaviors in general, and with respect to online music piracy in particular.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

It could be that potential benefits from increasing the certainty of punishment will be outweighed by negative effects on the industry’s image, hence might not be good to increase punishment for online pirates.\n* The results suggest that individuals’ intentions to commit online music piracy are influenced by their attitudes toward the behavior and their perceptions of the extent to which those that are important to them would approve of the behavior. Campaigns aimed at raising the public’s awareness of online music piracy and the associated negative consequences of the behavior may be an effective approach to combating online music piracy.\n|Description of Data=Data collected from a questionnaire were used to empirically test the research model.

S. copyright law effectively prevents direct price discrimination for copyright holders that sell to different markets. In response, these firms can engage in indirect price discrimination. I derive theoretical predictions about the use of indirect price discrimination, and I analyze how optimal pricing strategies differ for different products. Using data on VHS and DVD movie distribution, I find that firms’ pricing choices are consistent with the predictions of theory and that firms’ use of indirect price discrimination benefits consumers (but harms ancillary retailers). Finally, I examine what optimal pricing strategies might look like in a legal environment that permits direct price discrimination.\n|Authentic Link=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/3/1307.short\n|Link=https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/11676.html\n|Reference=Leslie (2004); Clerides (2002); Bergstrom (2001); Liebowitz (1986);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Decision to price discriminate depends on the expected costs and benefits of doing so,and empirical evidence shows that firms account for the costs and benefits of indirect price discrimination when choosing their optimal pricing strategies. Specifically, both demographic effects and product quality levels differ across the VHS and DVD formats and contribute to the different pricing strategies chosen for these two formats. However, the most important difference for explaining firms’ pricing decisions seems to be the relative value of owning a movie, which varies by movie and also by format.Welfare effects of the current price discrimination strategies used by firms in the United States is also examined and found that indirect price discrimination benefits copyright holders but generally harms retailers. Consumer welfare is highest under the current price discrimination strategies in use; thus, for some titles, indirect price discrimination benefits consumers, while for other titles, consumers are made worse off by this form of price discrimination.Welfare effects of an alternative form of copyright protection is also estimated that would allow for direct price discrimination, and found that price discrimination under this law tends to benefit copyright holders and consumers at the expense of retailers.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Journal of Economics & Management Strategy 14.1 (2005): 121-139.\n|Abstract=Software firms are observed to support programmers’ communities, which develop rival open source programs. A firm selling a copyright program has an incentive to support substitute copyleft programming when support creates compatibility between the programs and programs exhibit network effects. Costly compatibility benefits the firm as its consumers gain access to the community’s services but may also hurt the firm because it cannot profit from the valuation difference between incompatible networks. The incentive arises under a weak network effect even when the consumers’ benefit is small. Standardization and enlarging the open source programmers’ community do not always increase welfare.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1430-9134.2005.00036.x/abstract\n|Reference=Lerner and Tirole (2002); Landes and Posner (1989); Katz and Shapiro (1985); Banerjee (2003); Yoon (2001);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Firms seem willing to expend substantial resources to support a copyleft community even if the copyleft program will compete with the firm’s program. Support of copyleft development facilitates compatibility\nbetween the programs. Consumers’ willingness to pay for the firm’s program is increased with the introduction of a common network and a benefit from the user innovation of the copyleft programmers’ community. On the other hand, support is costly. More importantly, if the cost is low, compatibility removes the advantage in network\nvaluations that the firm enjoys under incompatibility. We determined the conditions for the firm to prefer support and thus compatibility instead of targeting to incompatibility. The welfare analysis showed\nthat standardization or society’s support of copyleft development might have adverse welfare implications in contrast to received views.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

However, the marginal effect is negative and very low.\n \n* The quest for cultural diversity makes individuals more likely to be a contributor than a free-rider in P2P networks. \n\n* The perception of legal and technical risks associated with sharing behaviour has no significant effect on contribution. \n\n* A moderate level of education is associated with a lower likelihood of being a contributor in P2P. \n\n* Age, income and occupation do not have a significant impact on behaviour in P2P networks. \n\n* Higher internet experience has significant positive impact on contribution behaviour. \n\n* Findings suggest that contribution behaviour is not well explained by an utilitarian approach. \n\n* Contribution behaviour can be motivated by social influence, and these practices are embedded in a social context. \n\n* Further research can explore the mechanisms by which this social influence explains the behaviour of contributors over P2P networks.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

However, the findings suggest copyright enforcement (in particular, increased sanctions, legal suits against individual copiers) has no impact on contribution behaviour. This might explain the failure of current enforcement strategies.\n\n* The findings cast some doubts on the efficiency of ‘réponse graduée,’ or the use of warnings and cease and desist letters: at best, this new form of copyright enforcement could eliminate the current P2P technology used to share contents. Any new sharing technology that would replace current P2P technology might be fuelled by the ‘supply’ of content contributors.\n\n* Another strategy is to decrease the relative utility of P2P networks by increasing the quality of services and diversity of contents available in the legal markets. Content industries should try to build innovative business models to compete efficiently with P2P content-sharing or even to extract the value from these sharing communities. \n\n* Copyright law could stimulate innovation by implementing compulsory licences in order to facilitate the acquisition of copyrights and increase the size of catalogue supplied to consumers in legal markets.\n|Description of Data=Online and pen/paper survey data gathered from 2533 individuals; sample reduced to 2068 after missing values were removed.

Yet in several recent empirical studies, leading scholars have found some order in fair use case law where others have seen only chaos. Building upon these studies and new empirical research, this Article examines fair use case law through the lens of the doctrine's chronological development and concludes that in fundamental ways fair use is a different doctrine today than it was ten or twenty years ago. Specifically, the Article traces the rise to prominence of the transformative use paradigm, as adopted by the Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, over the market-centered paradigm of Harper &amp; Row v. The Nation and its progeny. The Article presents data showing that since 2005 the transformative use paradigm has come overwhelmingly to dominate fair use doctrine, bringing to fruition a shift towards the transformative use doctrine that began a decade earlier. The Article also finds a dramatic increase in defendant win rates on fair use that correlates with the courts embrace of the transformative use doctrine. In' light of these developments, adding an historical dimension to a study of fair, use case law helps to make sense of what might otherwise appear to be a disconnected series of ad hoc, case-by-case judgments and explains why current rulings might seem to contradict those regarding like cases issued when the market-centered paradigm still reigned supreme.\n|Authentic Link=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/lewclr15&div=34&id=&page=\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1874778\n|Reference=Nimmer (2003); Beebe (2008); Samuelson (2009); Sag (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Over the past 20 years, the U.S. fair use doctrine has altered fundamentally, including moving from a focus on commercial use to greater emphasis on transformative use.

Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, 23(1), 43-53.\n|Abstract=Intellectual property piracy is a significant global problem and an enormous problem for U.S. companies and policymakers. This article examines why typically law-abiding people are more inclined to steal intellectual property products than more tangible, material products. The authors propose that the inclination to pay for certain types of goods and services is greater than for other types, and what distinguishes the two classes is their cost structure. They document how consumers are more or less\ninclined to pay for goods and services as a function of whether the product’s cost is principally attributable to variable cost (VC) or fixed cost (FC). The authors’ central thesis is that consumers (1)\nbelieve that they cause less harm if their failure to pay prevents a seller from recovering FC than if their failure to pay helps a seller recoup VC; (2) are more likely to risk not paying for a product the less harm they perceive that not paying would cause; and (3) therefore feel less obligated and are less likely to pay voluntarily for a high-FC, low-VC product than for a high-VC, low-FC product, when total cost and average cost are held constant. This research is particularly relevant in the information age, because it helps explain why consumers appear to be more inclined to risk stealing software and other intellectual property products with relatively high FC and little or no VC. It also allows for the creation of marketing remedies that do not involve further legal enforcement.\n|Authentic Link=http://journals.ama.org/doi/pdf/10.1509/jppm.23.1.43.30398\n|Link=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/pdf/whyarepeoplesoprone.pdf\n|Reference=Winer (1986); Campbell (1999); Bolton, Warlop and Alba (2003); Legard (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This research shows that:\n\n* consumers are much less intent on paying for or willing to pay less for products with relatively low variable cost (VC) and high fixed cost (FC), such as information products, than for products with a high ratio of VC to FC, such as more conventional tangible products. This may help explain why ordinarily law-abiding people are more likely to steal intangible products than material goods.\n\n* Consumers perceive failure to pay for a high-VC product as inflicting greater harm to a seller than failure to pay for a high-FC product. This is because consumers perceive amounts paid in excess of VC as a gain to the seller, and they perceive failure to cover the seller’s VC as inflicting a loss. Consumers are more likely to pay for a product the more harm they believe that not paying would cause.\n\n* This study has implications for consumer perceptions of fair price. Much of what consumers perceive as fair depends on how they believe that prices and a firm’s motive for charging prices affect firm or producer profitability. A price increase without a cost increase raises profits and is considered less fair than is a price increase associated with a cost increase.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

A prescription for marketers (manufacturers and sellers) of high fixed products is to better communicate a more accurate representation of total costs to consumers. Another way to increase consumers’ payment and purchase intentions is simply to increase the recognizable variable cost and thus to increase the ratio of variable cost to fixed cost.\n|Description of Data=This research is comprised of 3 studies:\nStudy 1, comprised of two parts; participants in the first part of Study 1 were 128 undergraduate business students.

M. Almost Wikipedia: Eight Early Encyclopedia Projects and the Mechanisms of Collective Action.''' [http://mako.cc/academic/hill-almost_wikipedia-DRAFT.pdf]\n\n\n''Abstract'': Before Wikipedia was created in January 2001, there were seven attempts to create English-language online collaborative encyclopedia projects. Several of these attempts built sus- tainable communities of volunteer contributors but none achieved anything near Wikipedia’s success. Why did Wikipedia, superficially similar and a relatively late entrant, attract a commu- nity of millions and build the largest and most comprehensive compendium of human knowl- edge in history? Using data from interviews of these Wikipedia-like projects’ initiators and extensive archival data, I suggest three propositions for why Wikipedia succeeded in mobilizing volunteers where these other projects failed.

Journal of political economy, 115(1), 1-42.\n|Abstract=For industries ranging from software to pharmaceuticals and entertainment, there is an intense debate about the appropriate level of protection for intellectual property. The Internet provides a natural crucible to assess the implications of reduced protection because it drastically lowers the cost of copying information. In this paper, we analyze whether file sharing has reduced the legal sales of music. While this question is receiving considerable attention in academia, industry, and Congress, we are the first to study the phenomenon employing data on actual downloads of music files. We match an extensive sample of downloads to U.S. sales data for a large number of albums. To establish causality, we instrument for downloads using data on international school holidays. Downloads have an effect on sales that is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Our estimates are inconsistent with claims that file sharing is the primary reason for the decline in music sales during our study period.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/511995\n|Link=http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~mshum/ec106/strumpf.pdf\n|Reference=Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2005); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Zentner (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* File-sharing has no statistically significant impact on the sales of albums surveyed in the study.\n\n* The authors attribute the downturn in the recording industry to a number of other factors: the reorganisation of retail and distribution towards centralised vendors such as major supermarkets as opposed to smaller record stores, the end of the windfall brought about by the 'CD replacement cycle' that saw consumers replace vinyl collections with CDs and the cannibalisation of 'wallet share' from other entertainment sources such as DVDs, video games and mobile devices.\n\n* File-sharing has no significant effect on the supply of recorded music or incentives to produce music.\n\n* For established artists that produce commercially relevant products the effects of file-sharing are to small to affect the volume or quality of works released. For new-entrants, the probability of success is so low that the effects of file-sharing make no relevant difference to incentives.\n\n* The volume of works downloaded by file-sharing coupled with the statistically insignificant impact on record sales, suggests file-sharing is likely to increase aggregate welfare.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

CeDER Working Paper No. 06-01. Available at SSRN 871243.\n|Abstract=The effective management of digital rights is the central challenge in many industries making the transition from physical to digital products. We present a new model that characterizes the value of these digital rights when products are sold both embedded in tangible physical artifacts, and as pure digital goods, and when granting rights permitted by one's digital rights management (DRM) platform may affect the extent of digital piracy. Our model indicates that in the absence of piracy, digital rights should be unrestricted, since a seller can use its pricing strategy to optimally balance sales between physical and digital goods. However, the threat of piracy limits the extent to which digital rights should be granted: the value of digital rights is determined not only by their direct effect on the quality of legal digital goods, but by a differential piracy effect that can lower a seller's pricing power. When the latter effect is sufficiently high, granting digital rights can have a detrimental effect on value - our model indicates that this kind of effect is more likely to be observed for digital rights that aim to replicate the consumption experience of physical goods, rather than enhancing a customer's digital experience. We test the predictions of our analytical model using data from the ebook industry. Our empirical evidence supports our theoretical results, showing that four separate digital rights each have an economically significant impact on ebook prices, and establishing that the digital rights which aim to replicate physical consumption while increasing the threat of piracy are the ones that have negative impact on seller value.\nWe also show that if the pricing of a digital good is keyed off that of an existing tangible good, optimal pricing changes for the former should be more nuanced, rather than simply mirroring changes in the price of the latter, and we discuss the effect of the technological sophistication of potential customers on optimal pricing and rights management. Our results represent new evidence of the importance of an informed and judicious choice of the different digital rights granted by a DRM platform, and provide a new framework for guiding managers in industries that are progressively being digitized.\n|Authentic Link=http://archive.nyu.edu/bitstream/2451/27796/2/CeDER-PP-2004-01.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=871243\n|Reference=Bhattacharjee, Gopal and Sanders (2003); Hui (2003); Zentner (2003); Sundararajan (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In the absence of a piracy threat, digital rights are always valuable through their direct effect on increasing the quality of digital goods. Any issues of cannibalization of the sales of physical goods can be effectively addressed by a strategic choice of pricing.\n\n* When granting digital rights in the presence of digital piracy, the value of these rights is governed by two opposing effects: a direct quality effect, or how much the granting of the right increases willingness to pay for the legal digital goods, and a differential piracy effect, that measures how much it reduces the relative surplus of consuming legal tangible and digital goods through its inducing digital piracy.\n\n* Each of four separate digital rights have both a statistically and economically significant impact on ebook prices, after controlling for tangible book price levels and category.\n\n* The variation in ebook prices we observe across categories suggests that an increase in technological sophistication of consumers is associated with an increase in the price of legal digital goods.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

University of Chicago Press.\n|Abstract=The advent of file sharing has considerably weakened effective copyright protection. Today, more than 60% of Internet traffic consists of consumers sharing music, movies, books, and games. Yet, despite the popularity of the new technology, file sharing has not undermined the incentives of authors to produce new works. We argue that the effect of file sharing has been muted for three reasons. (1) The cannibalization of sales that is due to file sharing is more modest than many observers assume. Empirical work suggests that in music, no more than 20% of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing. (2) File sharing increases the demand for complements to protected works, raising, for instance, the demand for concerts and concert prices. The sale of more expensive complements has added to artists’ incomes. (3) In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers. Since the advent of file sharing, the production of music, books, and movies has increased sharply.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11764.pdf\n|Link=http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11764.pdf\n|Reference=Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Bhattacharjee, Gopal, Lertwachara, Marsden and Telang (2007); Hong (2004); Andersen and Frenz (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are that the impact of file sharing on teh creation of new works has been muted for three reasons:\n\n1: The cannibalization of sales that is due to file sharing is more modest than many observers assume.

Ofcom. (2011)\n|Abstract=Under the Digital Economy Act, 2010, Ofcom must report progress in tackling online infringement. The overarching objective of this research project was to provide Ofcom with insight into the key drivers and motivations behind the online sharing and uploading of copyrighted material in order to further their understanding of the behaviour and attitudes displayed by file sharers. Much of the available published research in this area to date has focused on downloading activity. Ofcom therefore sought to focus this qualitative research on the uploading, rather than downloading, of unauthorised material. This report details the findings of the research with reference to the attitudes and motivations of file sharers in relation to file sharing behaviour and habits, perceptions of the risks associated with file sharing and participants’ justifications for file sharing. It also examines their awareness and understanding of the legal and potential consequences of their actions. The report ends with an exploration of a range of measures that are likely to deter people from continuing to file share in the future.\n|Authentic Link=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/filesharing/gfk.pdf\n|Link=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/filesharing/gfk.pdf\n|Reference=None;\n|Plain Text Proposition=The research identified four different types of file sharers:\n* Generation file-share: who have grown up in the digital age\n* Self-serving consumers: older adults, often with families and busy lives\n* Collectors: having  passion for particular content, often niche genres\n* Cybertechies: whose file sharing is driven by technology rather than content\n\nGenerally, file sharing is viewed as a mainstream activity –\nsomething that “everyone” is doing. Under-18s most strongly believe that it is the “normal” way to access content, typically popular music singles.\n\nThere is little sense of file sharing being a “community” activity, but, contrarily, there is some evidence that altruism motivates some participants’ file sharing.\n\nMany participants are naïve about how file sharing works. In particular, younger and less tech-savvy participants are most likely not to know that using P2P file sharing sites allows others to share their own files.\n\nThose who knowingly upload files tend to feel that they should continue to do so to give something back, and to allow file sharing to continue.\n\nSome participants seem to tacitly accept that file sharing is illegal, but many others debate and justify the ethics of their activities.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This is likely to result in them being able to view their own activity in a different light and deter them away from file sharing.\n|Description of Data=Initial desk research, followed by a qualitative opportunity sample of respondents (37 male, 10 female; age range 12 to 52) from BC1C2DE socio-economic groups in England, screened for eligibility, and stratified as mainstream, moderate or heavy file-sharers.

Any issues of cannibalization of the sales of physical goods can be effectively addressed by a strategic choice of pricing.\n\n*When granting digital rights in the presence of digital piracy, the value of these rights is governed by two opposing effects: a direct quality effect, or how much the granting of the right increases willingness to pay for the legal digital goods, and a differential piracy effect, which measures how much the digital right reduces the relative surplus of consuming legal tangible and digital goods through inducing digital piracy.\n\n*When the direct quality effect balances the differential piracy effect, then granting the right is beneficial to the seller. It raises prices and products from the sales of digital goods. This effect is more likely to be associated with rights that enhance the digital consumption experience of the good, rather than replicate the physical consumption experience, since consumers who purchase the digital good belong to the segment who value digital quality. If they valued the physical consumption experience, these consumers would have purchased the tangible good in the first place.\n\n*When the differential quality effect associated with a digital right exceeds the direct quality effect significantly, granting the right may affect the sellers pricing power adversely, since consumers who prefer digital goods over tangible goods need to be offered sufficient surplus to ensure that they do not simply resort to using a pirated copy of the good. This kind of right is generally likely to be one that attempts to replicate the physical consumption experience digitally. \n\n*In testing the theory’s predictions using pricing and digital rights data for over 30,000 ebooks, each of four digital rights has both a statistically and economically significant impact on ebook prices, after controlling for tangible book price levels, sales rank and category. \n\n*Results also show that a right that aims to replicate physical consumption characteristics (printing) has a negative impact on ebook prices, while rights enhancing the consumption experience by exploiting the fact that the book is now a digital good (copying) have a positive impact on prices.\n \n*The variation in ebook prices observed across categories suggests that an increase in technological sophistication of consumers is associated with an increase in the price of legal digital goods.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The predictions of this model are validated by empirical results, and suggest important new guidelines for managers in industries that are progressively being digitized. \n\n*As the pace of industry transformation by information technology accelerates over the coming years, managing such transitions will become central to continued business success across a wider variety of industries, thereby increasing the value of research that contributes to understanding of the transformational power of IT, and of how the Internet affects markets and industry structure. \n\n*Conversations with publishers have suggested they still price the tangible book independently, and then key the ebook price of this. However, a model of the simultaneous choice of tangible and digital pricing in the presence of piracy would be a useful extension, especially as digital goods gain prominence in more industries.\n\n*While most digital goods in other industries do not currently have the rich variation in rights across products that made our empirical study of ebook pricing viable, they are likely to in the near future, and may present the opportunity for studies similar to ours across other industries like music and broadcast video. There are also indications that new forms of pricing are forthcoming in the ebook industry, most notably pay-per-use pricing from Google.\n|Description of Data=A data set containing pricing and digital rights data for 32,092 ebook titles, across 55 categories, sold by a specialized web-based ebook retailer.

'Deep Dive' Analysis Report.\n|Abstract=Research overview \n\nBackground and objectives \n\nIn early 2012 Ofcom commissioned research designed to track consumers’ behaviour and attitudes towards both lawful and unlawful access of copyright material using the internet, relating to six content types; music, films, TV programmes, computer software, books and video games. The primary objective of this research was to gather data and generate insight by establishing initial benchmarks and trends that could be used to assist policy making related to online copyright enforcement. This followed the adoption by Government of a recommendation made in the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth that Ofcom should not wait until its progress-reporting duties under the Digital Economy Act came into force to begin gathering trends and benchmarks related to consumption of content online.\n\nThe research universe for this study was all adults aged 12+ in the UK. The survey used a mixed methodology approach whereby data was collected using both an online and offline sample. All material relating to the main tracking study, including key findings and full technical details, can be found at:\n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/ \n\nThe total sample achieved from the first two waves of the tracking study (covering the period May- October 2012) was 10,594, and this provided a robust and substantial base for the further statistical analysis in this report. The main aim of this analysis was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types of interest. There was a particular interest in understanding content infringers in more detail. The following streams of ‘deep dive’ analysis were undertaken:\n\n1. Decile behavioural analysis among infringers \n\nThis analysis segmented infringers into bands of 10% based on volume of content consumed illegally. This allows insight into the proportion of illegal content for which each decile of infringers is responsible. It is effectively a simple ‘behavioural’ segmentation based on the volume of infringement. In-depth profiling of the highest infringing decile groups (the top 20%) was then undertaken to allow greater understanding of high-volume infringers. \n\n2. Attitudinal segmentations amongst infringers and non-infringers \n\nIn addition to the decile behavioural analysis which segmented infringers on volume of illegal content consumed, we conducted an ‘attitudinal’ segmentation. The key inputs for this segmentation were motivations for infringing. Non-infringing consumers were also segmented separately according to their motivations for general online behaviour. Both the behavioural and the attitudinal segmentations can be used to help target groups of consumers based on their motivations. \n\n3. Infringement of multiple content types \n\nThe reports for the tracking study concentrated on general online behaviour and infringement per content type, and across all types. This extra layer of analysis was conducted in order to examine behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed i.e. are people actively infringing across multiple categories, and in what category combinations? \n\n4. Spend analysis among infringers \n\nAdditional analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content. \nFurther details of the specific analysis methodologies employed can be found in the Technical Appendix at the end of this document.\n|Authentic Link=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/telecoms-research/online-copyright/deep-dive.pdf\n|Link=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/high-volume-infringers/\n|Reference=Hargreaves (2011); Gowers (2006); Ofcom (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Key findings\n\nWe conducted a series of in-depth analyses using the combined data sets from the first two waves of the Online Copyright Infringement tracking study. The purpose was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types. The work revealed the following:\n\n\nDecile analysis: A more detailed look at the Top 20% Infringers\n\nInfringers were segmented into 10% groups according to the overall volume of content they indicated they had accessed illegally. The main findings were as follows:\n\n* The Top 10% Infringers accounted for just 1.6% of the 12+ internet user population, but were responsible for 79% of infringed content. The Top 20% infringers, accounting for 3.2% of 12+ internet users, were responsible for 88% of infringements.\n* Infringers were more male, 16-34 and ABC1 than the general internet population. However, the Top 20% Infringers were even more likely to be male and 16-34 than the Bottom 80%. (We used the Top 20% Infringers rather than the Top 10% Infringers as the larger sample size makes comparisons more robust).\n* Despite their high levels of infringement, the Top 20% Infringers also accounted for 11% of the legal content consumed.\n* The Top 20% Infringers also spent significantly more across all content types on average than either the Bottom 80% Infringers or the non-infringing consumers (£168 vs. £105 vs. £54 over the six month period covered).\n\n\nInfringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting by volume of content infringed, we also segmented infringers by their reasons for doing it. This resulted in four distinct infringing groups:\n\n1. Justifying Infringers (9% of infringers, 24% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the highest levels of infringement. They felt they had spent enough on content already, and this sentiment was confirmed by their high total spend offline. Most of their digital consumption was streamed and primarily related to music, though they also consumed the highest proportion of illegal books across the segments. Generally, they like to try before they buy (related to their willingness to spend) and appear to be the most receptive to good/well-priced legal alternatives.\n\n2. Digital Transgressors (9% of infringers, 22% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the youngest infringing group, with the majority in education. They had the highest levels of downloading behaviour and had higher consumption of films and TV programmes than the other high infringing group (Justifying Infringers). This group showed the least remorse about infringing material, but also had the highest fear of getting caught. In fact, they appeared to be the most receptive to receiving letters from ISPs alleging infringement.  \n\n3. Free Infringers (42% of infringers, 35% of infringed volume, 10% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the largest group and was chiefly defined by the fact they infringed because it was free. They paid for a low proportion of the content they consumed and had the lowest total content spend among the infringing segments. They were responsible for the high majority of illegal consumption of video games and computer software.\n\n4. Ambiguous Infringers (39% of infringers, 20% of infringed volume, 9% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the lowest levels of digital consumption and the highest proportion of paid and legal content. They generally offered fewer justifications for infringing and for stopping infringing. This appeared to be linked to their lower levels of infringing activity and a lack of confidence in knowing what is legal.\n\n* Infringers generally consumed more paid and legal content than the non-infringing segments, although this formed a lower proportion of their total consumption than it did for non-infringers.\n* Most infringing segments found it easy to find content on the internet for free which would normally be paid, ranging from 45% for the Ambiguous Infringers to 76% for the Top 20% infringers. Among non-infringers the figures were notably lower, ranging from 28% to 45%.\n\n\nNon-infringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting the infringers, we also segmented consumers who downloaded or streamed legal content only. The four groups are summarised as follows:\n\n1. Simple Streamers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group was primarily defined by the fact that they only streamed content and didn’t download any. This content largely comprised TV programmes and music and was generally accessed for entertainment and convenience purposes.\n\n2. Simple Downloaders (17% of legal consumers , 13% of total digital consumers):\n\nThey were defined by the fact that they only downloaded and didn’t stream. They consumed less content than the other non-infringing segments, and largely downloaded books and music. Despite this, relatively they had the largest proportion of paid-for content.\n\n3. Paying Consumers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group paid for the majority of the content that they consumed, while also spending a lot on offline (such as physical) content.\n\n4. Free Opportunists (14% of legal consumers, 11% of total digital consumers):\n\n100% of this group claimed to download because it is free. They consumed a higher volume of free content than any of the other non-infringing segments.\n\n\nInfringement of multiple content types\n\nWe also analysed behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed.\n\n* Most people (62%) contained their infringement to only one content type of the six measured in the study, and this was predominantly music (42%) or films (28%).\n* Where there was infringement in more than one content type it generally included combinations of music, films and TV programmes. Infringement of computer software and video games was more prevalent among those that had infringed across four or more content types.\n* Those that infringed across multiple content types also infringed a higher volume of content on average.\n* Category spend was highest for those that infringed in three content types. \n\n\nSpend analysis among infringers\n\nFurther analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content, and to assess the revenue potential if infringement could be converted to legal consumption:\n\n* Generally, the data from the survey showed that as people consumed more infringed files they also consumed more legal files, and spent more on legal content.\n* Further assessment on price-sensitivity for music showed that the optimum price infringers were willing to pay (either for single downloadable tracks, or for particular premium subscriptions) generally increased as the volume of infringed content increased. (Although the optimum subscription price was below that currently charged for the first premium tier of a number of UK music streaming services, many also offer free versions, albeit with some service restrictions or limitations).\n* This optimum music price was mapped alongside banded illegal consumption in order to estimate potential additional monthly spend (lost revenue) if all infringed content was paid for at this price.\n* The data suggest that improvements to legal alternatives could potentially convert some music infringers to pay for their content (either by track or monthly) if the price was right. However, the relationship between infringement and spend is complex and the claims people make when asked questions about their likely future behaviour given changes to their options do not always closely reflect their real-life behaviour.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Details of the data collection method and weighting can be found in the main report: \n\nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/ \n\nThe total sample of the database was 10,594. \n\nIn terms of volumes all respondents were asked about their behaviour during the past three months. However, as the database is combined from two separate waves these two periods differ (May-July and August-October 2012). Therefore, all aggregated volumes are indicative of this six-month period. \n\n\nAnalysis methods \n\nDecile analysis \n* The estimated volume of illegal content was derived for each respondent using the equation: \n* Respondents were grouped into 10% bands using their respective illegal volumes for each content type and at a total level. \n* The cumulative volume of illegal content for each decile band was then calculated and divided by the total number in order to create a percentage of total illegal content accountable for. \n\nSegmentation of infringers \n* The total sample was split into its four natural groupings: non internet users, non-digital consumers (i.e. consumers who do not download, stream or share on line), 100% legal consumers and any illegal consumers. \n* The segments were derived from a factor-cluster analysis using responses to ‘reasons for infringing’17 as well as the volume of infringement. \n* An eight-factor solution was then chosen on the basis of Eigen values and factor comprehension. \n* A two-stage cluster analysis was used to create the cluster seeds While the final cluster solution was \ncreated using a K-means cluster analysis. \n* A four-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of cluster membership homogeneity, cluster heterogeneity and cluster comprehension. \n\nSegmentation of non-infringers \n* The 100% legal consumers were analysed separately from the non-internet users, non-digital consumers and infringing consumers. \n* The segments were created using a similar factor-cluster analysis process as the infringing segmentation. However, the inputs here were the reasons for downloading rather than buying a physical version, and the reasons for streaming or accessing content. \n* A four- and a three-factor solution were chosen, again, on the basis of Eigen values and factor comprehension. \n* A two-stage cluster analysis was used to create the cluster seeds while the final cluster solution was created using a K-means cluster analysis. \n*A four-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of cluster membership homogeneity, and cluster heterogeneity, as well as cluster comprehension. \n* A count variable was created on respondent level data for the number of content types for which the individual consumed infringed content, using the derived illegal file calculation outline in section 3.2: \n*This was repeated for 100% illegal consumption over the different content types. \n* The attitudes and behaviours of the different platform groups were then further analysed.\n|Data Year=The data cover the period May-October 2012, mainly by combining two waves of data: May-July and August-October 2012.\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation)\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing; Film and motion pictures; Television programmes; Software publishing (including video games); Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing;\n|Country=UK;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=Ofcom;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=10,594\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=May-October 2012\n}}{{Dataset}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}]}

Using an original data set containing all 2.3 million registrations from 2008 to 2012, we provide a snapshot of current patterns of registration. We describe who is registering what, where, when, and why. Our main findings include the types of work being registered, how the registrations of individuals and firms differ, when works are being registered relative to their date of creation and date of publication, the age distribution of authors in different creative fields, and the geographic distribution and concentration of registration claimants.\n\nThe registration data collected and reported are superior to those relied upon in prior literature, and should therefore prove useful to lawmakers and scholars wishing to measure the effect of copyright law on creativity or otherwise reform our copyright law.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.texaslrev.com/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2441378\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Landes and Posner (2003); Oliar and Matich (2014); Ku, Sun and Fan (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The authors found: \n\n*Substantial variation in the data across types of authors and types of creative works. \n\n*Firms tend to cluster geographically and register published works, audiovisual works, serials, and computer files. \n\n*Individuals tend to create at geographically dispersed locations, and register unpublished, musical and dramatic works.\n\n*Registration of text works are evenly split between firms and individuals.\n\n*Authors of different genres tend to create at different ages: authors of music tend to be younger than authors of computer programs, who tend to be younger than authors of literary works.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

A program was used to systematically download registrations 2008–2012.

Copyright Preregistration: Evidence and Lessons from the First Seven Years, 2005-2012.\n|Abstract=In this Article, we study how the preregistration system was formed and then used in its first years. The analysis of the system’s use is informed, first, by a quantitative analysis of preregistration records. We retrieved the preregistrations of all 6,086 works dated from the launch of the system in November of 2005 through December 31, 2012. Of these, 2,525 were later registered, and we retrieved all of these subsequent registrations as well. We report various preregistration and subsequent registration statistics broken down by year, category of work, and type of preregistrant, and discuss several notable patterns in the data. Our analysis is also informed by interviews with lawyers and preregistrants, which we quote from\nthroughout the Article, conducted in order to get insiders’ views of the system and to augment and help make sense of the quantitative data.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2352792\n|Reference=Liye Ma et. al (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The Article recommends that: \n\n* the duration of preregistrations should be limited; \n\n* preregistration (and other copyright) fees should vary with entity size. \n\nIt offers lessons for formalities and copyright reform: \n\n* Digital-age formalities may not give rise to the distributional concerns that characterized old formalities; \n\n* newly minted formalities may limit, rather than expand, access to expressive works; \n\n* the rates of subsequent registration of preregistered works vary across categories and can inform copyright lawmaking; \n\n* the Copyright Office’s views may be affected by its institutional interest.\n\nThe study recommended the desirability of limiting the duration of preregistrations and of varying preregistrations fees according to entity size. More generally, the study suggested that formalities may not necessarily entail an adverse distributive effect, nor a necessary beneficial effect on access to expressive works. Preregistration data provide valuable information concerning works’ effective commercial life that can help policymaking on copyright duration. The Copyright Office was suggested to have had an agency role in the creation of the preregistration system.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Landes and Posner’s “most interesting result” in their regression analysis was that registrations are highly sensitive to increase in fees.They thus suspect that many works have negligible expected value.

The Report identifies a wide range of concerns, including: (a) the deterioration in IPR protection, enforcement, and market access for persons relying on IPR in a number of trading partners; (b) reported inadequacies in trade secret protection in China, India, and elsewhere, as well as an increasing incidence of trade secret misappropriation; (c) troubling “indigenous innovation” policies that may unfairly disadvantage\nU.S. rights holders in China; (d) the continuing challenges of online copyright piracy in countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Russia and trademark counterfeiting in China and elsewhere; (e) market access barriers, including nontransparent and discriminatory measures, that appear to impede access to products embodying IPR and measures that impede market access for U.S. entities that rely upon IPR protection; and (f) other ongoing, systemic IPR enforcement issues in many trading partners around the world.\n|Authentic Link=https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2015-Special-301-Report-FINAL.pdf\n|Link=https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2015-Special-301-Report-FINAL.pdf\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The Report informs the public and our trading partners and can serve as a positive catalyst for change.\nUSTR looks forward to working closely with the governments of the trading partners that are identified in this year’s Report to address both emerging and continuing concerns, and to continue to build on the positive results that many of these governments have achieved.\n|Description of Data=This Report follows intensive deliberations among all relevant agencies within the U.S. Government, informed by extensive consultation with participating stakeholders, foreign governments, the U.S. Congress, and other interested parties.\nUSTR, together with the Special 301 Subcommittee, conducts a broad and balanced assessment of U.S. trading partners’ IPR protection and enforcement, as well as related market access issues affecting IPR-intensive industries, in accordance with the statutory criteria set out by the U.S. Congress. (See Annex 1). The Special 301 Subcommittee, through the TPSC, provides country placement recommendations to the USTR based on this assessment.\nThe Special 301 Subcommittee reviewed 72 trading partners during the 2015 Special 301 process. The Subcommittee received stakeholder input on nearly 100 trading partners, but focused its review on those submissions that responded to the request set forth in the notice published in the Federal Register to identify whether a particular trading partner should be named as a Priority Foreign Country (PFC), placed on the Priority Watch List (PWL) or Watch List (WL), or not listed in the Report. Following extensive research and analysis, USTR has listed 37 trading partners\n|Data Year=2014-2015\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative data/text mining, Document Research\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Film and motion pictures; Television programmes; Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Software publishing (including video games);\n|Country=Global;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=Office of the United States Trade Representative;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=37\n|Level of Aggregation=Country,\n|Data Material Year=2014-2015\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1994, 'title': 'Oliar and Sprigman (2009)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Oliar and Sprigman (2009)\n|Author=Oliar, D.; Sprigman, C.\n|Title=There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up Comedy\n|Year=2009\n|Full Citation=Oliar, D., & Sprigman, C. (2008). There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up Comedy. Virginia Law Review, 1787-1867.\n|Abstract=In this paper, we analyze how stand-up comedians protect their jokes using a system of social norms. Intellectual property law has never protected comedians effectively against theft. Initially, jokes were virtually in the public domain, and comedians invested little in creating new ones. In the last half century, however, comedians have developed a system of IP norms. This system serves as a stand-in for formal law. It regulates issues such as authorship, ownership, transfer of rights, exceptions to informal ownership claims and the imposition of sanctions on norms violators. Under the norms system, the level of investment in original material has increased substantially. We detail these norms, which often diverge from copyright law's defaults. Our description is based on interviews with comedians, snippets of which we include throughout the paper. \n\nOur study has implications for intellectual property theory and policy. First, its suggests that the lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. Second, it suggests that the rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. Third, we suggest that comedians' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. Fourth, we note that stand-up's norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer. We suggest that the system's crude rights structure is driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. Lastly, social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law's one-size-fits-all mold. They do so, moreover, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying. \n\nStand-up's norms system has both benefits and costs, which we detail in the paper. However, norms-based IP systems offer an alternative (or supplementary) cost/benefit bundle which in some cases may be superior to that of formal law alone. In stand-up's case, norms economize on enforcement costs and appear to maintain a healthy level of incentives to create alongside a greater diversity in the kinds of humor produced. A final assessment of stand-up's social norms system awaits further work. With what we currently know, we are cautiously optimistic.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25470605?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1138376\n|Plain Text Proposition=# Lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. \n# The rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. \n# Comedians' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. \n# Stand-up's norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer, driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. \n# Social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law's one-size-fits-all mold, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

An enriched form of the theory of planned behavior can identify drivers of consumer intentions to adopt a legal movie download service. Using a large data set, this study estimates structural equation model parameters. The magnitude of specific influences is subject to unobserved heterogeneity, according to a finite mixture approach with partial least squares estimation. Not only attitude, but also social influence, perceived technical feasibility, innovativeness, compatibility, and past behavior drive adoption decisions.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08997760802300530\n|Reference=Jedidi, Krider and Weinberg (1998); Elberse and Eliashberg (2003); Chih-Chen (2005); Fetscherin (2005); Eliashberg et al.

Marketing campaigns should target online candidates because they will be attracted to new services rather than current heavy users/movie lovers.\n* These findings do not support the industry’s widespread fear that the introduction of an attractive movie download shop would lead to immediate cannibalization.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Youth, creativity, and copyright in the digital age.\n|Abstract=New digital networked technologies enable users to participate in the consumption, distribution, and creation of content in ways that are revolutionary for both culture and industry. As a result, “Digital Natives”—young people growing up in the digital world with access to the technologies and the skills to use them in sophisticated ways—are now confronting copyright law on a regular basis. This article presents qualitative research conducted with students age 12–22 that explores youth understanding, attitudes, and discourse on the topic of digital creativity and copyright law. Our findings suggest that young people operate in the digital realm overwhelmingly ignorant of the rights, and to a lesser degree the restrictions, established in copyright law. They often engage in unlawful behavior, such as illegal peer-to-peer music downloading, yet they nevertheless demonstrate an interest in the rights and livelihoods of creators. Building upon our findings of the disconnect between technical, legal, and social norms as pertaining to copyright law, we present the initial stages of the development of an educational intervention that posits students as creators: the Creative Rights copyright curriculum. Educating youth about copyright law is important for empowering young people as actors in society, both in terms of their ability to contribute to cultural knowledge with creative practices and to engage with the laws that govern society.\n|Authentic Link=http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3128762\n|Reference=Palfrey and Gasser (2008); Johnson (2008); Rainie (2006); Madden and Lenhart (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Found a lack of knowledge among young people regarding the rights and restrictions inscribed in copyright law. Even when youth are aware of the illegality of their actions in  consuming and sharing copyrighted content online,  their behavior mostly persists. \n\n* Youth tend to have a vague knowledge of the illegality of copyright infringement, they have almost no awareness of the rights copyright law affords to users to create with copyrighted content.\n\n* Fear of getting caught—either through a record company lawsuit or by their parents is one motivation for a few students to avoid engaging in infringing activity, another reason repeatedly arose in our interviews: respect for the creator. This view was more prominent among those students who engaged in creative activities themselves.\n\n* Apparent sincerity of claims varied, the livelihood and interests of the artists were very much present in youth discourse around downloading—suggesting that consideration for the artists.\n\n* Respect was limited (and emphasized financial impact in particular), a respect for creators and their livelihoods was pervasive in the young people’s discussion of the ethics of using  others’ creative works.\n\n* Continues by outlining an education program for youth in which above issues are addressed in order to educate youth about copyright.\n\nSuggest that education, rather than litigation, is the best way to bridge these gaps and reforge connections between creative industries and their young consumers\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Convergence through mobile peer-to-peer file sharing in the Republic of Armenia. International Journal of Communication, 5, 511-528.\n|Abstract=Armenians are adopting personal computers and the Internet more slowly than are individuals in neighboring and more economically developed countries. However, mobile phone usage is rapidly expanding. The reasons for this pattern of information and communications technology adoption may be cultural, political, or economic, but the delay in some technological access also, paradoxically, fosters creativity. Through peer-to-peer content sharing via mobile devices, the consumption and exchange of digital content has become quite common. Indeed, these uses of the mobile phone exemplify convergence, the integration of digital audio, video, text, and data, as well as a social change in the way media circulates. Ethnographic research and interviews conducted in Armenia during the spring and summer of 2008 examine how, by whom, and what types of digital content are being socially shared through mobile devices. Theoretical possibilities to explain the social utility of this phenomenon are presented as well.\n|Authentic Link=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/800\n|Link=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/pdf/whyarepeoplesoprone.pdf\n|Reference=Atkin (2002); Herring (2006); Taylor and Harper (2002); Wei (2008); Wirth, von Pape and Karnowski (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The absence of other ICTs (PCs and the Internet in particular) which have traditionally led the way for digitalized content consumption and sharing, and the arrival of multimedia phones in Armenia have created a situation in which device convergence enables media convergence. The social harmonious nature of Armenian society may influence this convergence.\n\n* Armenian social structures related to social capital and social maintenance are also relevant to understanding social sharing. Social capital is the individual and social resources developed and made accessible through relationships and interpersonal trust among individuals in a social network.\n\n* Armenia’s challenging political situation has created an interesting use of mobile multimedia through peer-to-peer file sharing that may be used in other heated political situations. While it remains to be seen if motivations for the use of entertainment content have any relationship to motivations for the use of political information content, the skill involved in receiving, viewing and sharing the content and the political contexts for sharing otherwise censored information are there.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Software piracy in the workplace: A model and empirical test. Journal of Management Information Systems, 20(1), 153-177.\n|Abstract=Theft of software and other intellectual property has become one of the most visible problems in computing today. This paper details the development and empirical validation of a model of software piracy by individuals in the workplace. The model was developed from the results of prior research into software piracy, and the reference disciplines of the theory of planned behavior, expected utility theory, and deterrence theory. A survey of 201 respondents was used to test the model. The results indicate that individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant precursors to the intention to illegally copy software. In addition, punishment severity, punishment certainty, and software cost have direct effects on the individual’s attitude toward software piracy, whereas punishment certainty has a significant effect on perceived behavioral control. Consequently, strategies to reduce software piracy should focus on these factors. The results add to a growing stream of information systems research into illegal software copying behavior and have significant implications for organizations and industry groups aiming to reduce software piracy.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1976963\n|Reference=Christensen and Eining (1991); Harrington (1996); Gopal, and Sanders (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* 52% of the total sample admitted to illegally copying software at least once a year. 59.2% stated they had copied software illegally at least once. Only 6.5% indicated they knew someone who had been caught. \n* For organizations, the results imply that the factors identified by TPB can be manipulated to yield the desired effects.\n* The strength of the relationship between punishment certainty and perceived behavioral control indicates that the more likely an individual perceives the chance of being caught, the less the individual perceives himself or herself as having the ability to commit software policy. \n* Software cost also plays an important role in modifying the individual’s attitude toward piracy. The lower the cost, the less gain if it is illegally copied; by contrast, if it is very expensive, the perceived benefits of purchasing the software may be outweighed by its cost. \n* Attitude toward software piracy is clearly the strongest predictor of software piracy intention. Perceived behavioral control had the last impact on piracy intention in the proposed model.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The Cuban new media landscape is supported by informal networks that blend financial and social exchanges to circulate goods, media, and currency in ways that are often illegal but are largely tolerated. Presenting two case studies of young, educated Cubans who rely on the circulation of film and television content via external hard drives for most of their media consumption, I suggest that the emphasis of much existing literature on the role of state censorship and control in Cuban new media policy overlook the everyday practices through which Cubans are regularly engaged with Latin and U.S. American popular culture. Further, informal economies have been central to everyday life in Cuba both during the height of the Soviet socialist era and in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union that has seen a juxtaposition of some market reforms alongside centrally planned policies. In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances. Understanding the informal media economy of Cuba within this broader context helps to explain how the consumption of commercial American media is largely uncontroversial within Cuban everyday life despite the fraught politics that often dominates discussions of Cuban media policy.\n|Authentic Link=http://tvn.sagepub.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/content/13/5/399.full.pdf+html\n|Reference=Castells and Portes (1989); Silverstone and Hirsch (1992);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results reported in the study:\n\n*The media landscape of Cuba is characterized by a deep connection to transnational circuits of media consumption despite official and technological isolation that limits the everyday connectivity of most Cubans to new media and information technologies.\n\n*Although Cubans complain about the dullness of nationally produced television, or about the prohibitive prices of media technologies, at the same time they engage daily in the consumption of transnational media that is either legal and state supported or largely informal or illegal but clearly tolerated by the state.\n\n*Cubans supplement their television consumption with other media, not to access entertainment that is otherwise prohibited via state broadcasting but rather to increase the hours of leisure time spent watching films and television, to “time-shift” their viewing outside the broadcast schedule, to seek out special titles or genres that are not prohibited, and to share media as a social practice by which relationships are maintained and, in some cases, profits are gained.\n\n*In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages, and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances.

International Journal of Industrial Organization, 24(5), 907-913.\n|Abstract=Downloading digital products for free may harm creators and intermediaries because consumers may no longer buy the version for sale. However, as we show in this paper, this negative effect may be overcompensated by a positive effect due to sampling: consumers are willing to pay more because the match between product characteristics and buyers’ tastes is improved. This indeed holds under sufficient taste heterogeneity and product diversity.\nWe present a simple multi-product monopoly model in which products are located on the Salop circle and in which consumers regard each original as superior to its copy. We first consider a model with unit demand and full participation so that any increase in revenues stems from higher prices. The property that sampling allows consumers to find a better match to their tastes, tends to lead to higher profits under file-sharing. However, there is a countervailing effect: consumers have the option to download and listen to music without paying for it. In other words, consumers have the option to simply keep the download but not to buy the song or album. This tends to make not buying a more attractive option and tends to reduce the willingness-to-pay for music. We show that the former effect dominates the latter and that the introduction of file-sharing technologies leads to higher profits if there is\nsufficient taste heterogeneity and sufficient product diversity. We then extend the model to allow for variable demand and show that file-sharing can lead to lower prices, higher unit\nsales and higher profits\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718705001682\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=829544\n|Reference=Conner and Rumelt (1991); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2003); Takeyama (1994); Shy and Thisse (1999);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Do music labels necessarily suffer from downloading on P2P networks?

H. (2011). New business models for music. Villanova Sports and Entertainment Law Journal 63.\n|Abstract=This article is the fourth in a series by this author seeking to explore the impact of the technological revolution in the music industry. The first three built the case for three propositions concerning costs, copyright, and DRM, while this article explores the question of what economic incentives will suffice to facilitate an effective market in the absence of intellectual-property or copy protection. It bases its analysis, in part, on empirical evidence collected from interviews with musicians and music consumers.\n\nThe article first defines the problem: explaining why the old business models have eroded in the face of new technologies and of the changing role of the law — especially copyright law. Then, it builds on the author’s work in his New Architectures article, explaining who makes music, who consumes it, and why. These sections explain that while money plays a role in the marketplace for music, it is secondary to “hedonic” factors both for musicians, who make music largely for self-expressive and self-affirmation reasons, and for consumers, who listen to music for reasons including idiosyncratic perceptions of its quality, a desire to be part of a particular crowd, and vicarious identification with or attraction to the performers.\n\nThis Article then explores the essential role that intermediaries play in the marketplace. This section acknowledges that the new kinds of intermediation needed in the new technology-driven market place will not occur unless intermediaries can make money. Building on this foundation, this Article develops the elements of a business model that can sustain new forms of intermediation.\n|Authentic Link=http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/mslj/vol18/iss1/3/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2175782\n|Reference=Caves (2002); Lacher and Mizerski (1994); Anorga (2003); Eisenberg (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main propositions of the study: \n\n*This article explores the question of what economic incentives will suffice to facilitate an effective market in the absence of intellectual-property or copy protection.\n\n*There is no sustainable business model for indie musicians unless new sources of revenue can be tapped.\n\n*New revenue sources include: Live performances, publishing, merchandise, ring tones, music tracks for movies, advertising, and access to celebrity.\n\n*Income from creative endeavors has greater variance than day-job income and is more evenly distributed among artists who can support themselves solely from their art than among artists who depend on day-job income. This suggests that the lower one travels down on the status hierarchy, the greater the variance in revenues and income.\n\n*The job of the new intermediaries is to shift the probability function to increase the likelihood of celebrity status, while not eliminating uncertainty altogether.\n\n*Copyright becomes mostly irrelevant in a market in which technology has reduced the cost of producing and distributing recorded music to near zero and competition has force prices to these near-zero costs. \n\n*Copyright still has a role to play in mitigating large-scale commercial piracy, and  trademark can play a major role in protecting the identities and personas of musicians.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Build a community around the persona and music of a musician.\n\n*2. Involve the community in shaping the musical and other performance activities of the musician. Offer new songs free to this community and to others who might be motivated to join it.\n\n*3. Design and make available other products and activities that fans are willing to pay for. These might include more elaborate forms or mixes of the free songs, paid concerts, videos highlighting the personalities and social activities of the musicians, and special “backstage” opportunities for fans to interact with the musicians.\n\n*4.

An Exploration of the Use of Legal Scholarship in Intellectual Property Decisions (February 8, 2013). Houston Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 2, 2013; Loyola-LA Legal Studies Paper No. 2013-8.\n|Abstract=The argument that the Federal Circuit is an insular court lacking in intellectual curiosity has invaded academic discourse about the court and its jurisprudence. It is rarely used as a compliment. It is rather used as an epithetic description intended to have broad explanatory power for nearly any of the many and glaring limitations that speakers and commentators contend exist in the court’s body of law. The empirical basis for the argument comes from a single finding: that between 1996 and 2000 the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals referenced legal scholarship in their decisions in trademark and copyright cases nearly four times as often as the Federal Circuit referenced legal scholarship in its decisions in patent cases. While scholars and others have relied upon this finding to assert that the Federal Circuit’s performance is intellectually deficient, there are reasons to question whether that inference is proper. For instance, it stands in contrast to other observations that suggest the Federal Circuit behaves a lot like the regional circuits when it comes to its relationship to legal scholarship. \n\nIn this study, we explore the U.S. Supreme Court’s use of legal scholarship in its patent, trademark, and copyright jurisprudence. We report evidence of striking differences in the use of scholarship that depend on whether a decision concerns patent, trademark, or copyright law. The Court uses scholarship in patent decisions at a rate of 28%, but uses it around twice as often in its copyright (67%) and trademark (53%) decisions. While, moreover, the rates at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its copyright and trademark decisions are some of the highest observed in the Court’s entire jurisprudence, the rate at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its patent decisions is among the lowest observed. This Article discusses the significance of these observations to the empirical basis for the epithetic argument that the Federal Circuit is more insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity than other circuit courts of appeals.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2214025\n|Reference=Nard (2002); Petherbridge and Schwartz (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article argues against the epithetic accusation that that Federal Circuit judges are insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity. More specifically, this paper shows that: \n\n* Empirical support for the chain of reasoning linking differential citation to intellectual deficiency is weak, if not extremely weak.\n\n* Differential use of legal scholarship is a more natural phenomenon that may be unconnected, at least in many instances, from a courts intellectual connectedness to ongoing law and policy discourse.\n|FundamentalIssue=3.

Like the music, film, and publishing industries, it derives value from the creation of new, original works of authorship. But unlike rights holders in those more traditional creative industries, tattoo artists rarely assert formal legal rights in disputes over copying or ownership of the works they create. Instead, tattooing is governed by a set of nuanced, overlapping, and occasionally contradictory social norms enforced through informal sanctions. And in contrast to other creative communities that rely on social norms because of the unavailability of formal intellectual property protection, the tattoo industry opts for self-governance despite the comfortable fit of its creative output within the protections of the Copyright Act.\nThis Article relies on qualitative interview data drawn from more than a dozen face-to-face conversations with professionals in the tattoo industry. Based on those interviews, it offers a descriptive account of the social norms that have effectively displaced formal law within the tattoo community, provides a set of complementary cultural and economic explanations for the development of those norms, and outlines the broader implications of this research for intellectual property law and policy.\n|Authentic Link=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&context=faculty_publications\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2145048\n|Reference=Jones (2000); Rosenblatt (2011); Fagundes (2012); Cummings (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The tattoo, though formally embraced by the copyright system, fits rather awkwardly in any property regime.\n\n* Although they are unlikely to express themselves in terms of property theory, tattooers see their work as a sui generis amalgam of art, commerce, and human tradition. Perhaps then, it is not entirely surprising that they have opted to regulate this unique form of expression with rules crafted and enforced within their community.\n\n* The norms tattooers have developed serve a number of overlapping purposes. They protect both the relationship between tattooer and client and the underlying assertion of personal sovereignty the tattoo represents by guaranteeing client autonomy.\n\n* The value of these norms is not confined to tattooers and their clients. They offer the rest of us something as well. They demonstrate that the assumptions upon which we base intellectual property law are empirically untested and myopically focused on a tiny sliver of overall creative production defined by legacy business models.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Through a multiple regression, only personal factors have shown significant relationship with attitudes towards software piracy. Further results from this study have supported that favourable attitudes towards pirated software is likely to result in stronger intentions to use pirated software. It was found that computer proficiency acts as a predictor for intentions towards pirated software, rather than a moderator as originally postulated.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-009-0247-1#page-1\n|Reference=Logsdon et al. (1994); Ang et al. (2001); Hinduja (2003); Gupta et al. (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The study investigated the factors influencing consumers' attitudes and usage intentions toward pirated software and confirmed that an individual with favourable attitudes toward software piracy will also have stronger intentions to use pirated software. Furthermore, the study found that there are additional factors beyond ethical and legal considerations that influence attitudes toward software piracy. The results of the study were as follows: \n\n* Factor analysis showed three distinct factors to construct 'attitudes toward software piracy': ethical belief, social cost of piracy and anti-big business attitudes;\n\n* An individual's attitude toward software piracy is positively influenced by value consciousness (the perceived value of pirate software) and amount of computer usage; \n\n* Integrity had a significant influence on forming negative attitudes towards software piracy. With a lower emphasis placed on integrity, there is likely to be more favourable attitudes towards software piracy. This result conflicts with prior studies, which suggested many individuals do not perceive software piracy as an ethical issue;\n\n* Value consciousness has proven to be a dominant factor in predicting attitudes towards software piracy;\n\n* Risk aversion, normative and informative influences and self-gratification are found not significant predictors of attitudes towards software piracy;\n\n* Perceived chance of getting caught may have a stronger influence on software piracy than perceived severity of punishment. Despite the prospect of punishment, many are still using pirate software because they perceive that there is a low chance of detection and getting caught;\n\n* Computer proficiency is a significant predictor of intentions to use pirated software.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Specific implications for policy makers and software manufacturers are as follows:\n\n\n* A possible direction to curb software piracy is to reduce the perceived benefit of disseminating pirated software through emphasising the social costs attached with piracy;\n\n*  Students do possess anti-big business attitude toward software companies. These companies could improve their corporate image and battle piracy by: (1) Playing a more proactive role in community services to show greater social responsibility and (2) Adopt pricing strategies to counteract the price differential for legitimate/pirate software in countries with lower GNP (proven to face more serious problems of software piracy);\n\n* Because value consciousness was a predominant factor in predicting attitudes towards pirated software, lowering prices or even providing non-duplicable features in software programs could help to match customers perceived value of legitimate software to pirate software;\n\n* Enforcements of strict copyright laws are a necessary step to clamp down software piracy. Merely raising the level of punishment may not be able to deter software piracy; \n\n* Efforts should be focused on ‘sources’ and sellers and buyers of pirated software programs.\n|Description of Data=The study used questionnaire survey data obtained from 344 students of three undergraduate lectures at an unspecified university institution. There was 165 male (48%) and 179 female (52%) respondents. The majority of respondents fall within the age bracket of 18–24 (81.1%) followed by 25–34 (17.7%) and 35 and above (1.2%) age brackets. The amount of computer usage was recoded into three categories, i.e. low, moderate and heavy users in order to generate a larger sample size for analysis. 68 respondents (19.8%) were low users (0–24 h/week), 212 (61.6%) respondents were moderate users (24–60 h/week) and 64 (18.6%) were heavy users (more than 60 h/week). The survey instrument was made up of four sections comprising established scales and demographic questions. Section A measured all the independent variables. Section B examined attitudes and the purchase intentions towards pirated software. Section C comprised items regarding computer usage patterns and frequency. Section D measured purchasing habits of pirated software and demographic information of respondents. All items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 representing ‘‘strongly disagree’’ and 7 representing ‘‘strongly agree’’.\n|Data Year=2009\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Data Source=None;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Correlation and Association, Regression Analysis, Factor Analysis\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games);\n|Country=Australia;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=None;\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1778, 'title': 'Photographic activities', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Industry}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1916, 'title': 'Physics', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{REF Unit of Assessment}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1939, 'title': 'Philosophy', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{REF Unit of Assessment}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2563, 'title': 'Philip, F', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

Examining "peer-to-peer" (P2P) systems as consumer-to-consumer (C2C) exchange. European Journal of Marketing, 42, 1179-1202.\n|Abstract=Purpose – The exchange of goods between individual consumers being facilitated by the internet and “peer-to-peer” (P2P) systems is severely altering the business landscape. In broader terms, P2P exchanges are a form of what has occasionally been labeled “consumer-to-consumer” (C2C) exchange. What little work there is in business research which has examined both C2C and P2P exchange has to-date been largely anecdotal or conceptual. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.\nDesign/methodology/approach – A model of antecedents germane to the P2P phenomenon is formulated and empirically tested which includes the consumer’s satisfaction with, extent of usage of, and future behavioral intentions toward P2P exchanges as the focal endogenous constructs of interest.\nFindings – The model is tested with perceptual and archival data from a survey of consumers active in one prevalent form of P2P exchange (i.e. the “swapping” of pirated music). The model explains significant variance in all three focal endogenous constructs.\nResearch limitations/implications – The primary limitations include the study’s exploratory nature and not being able to incorporate all potentially salient constructs and variables germane to the P2P phenomenon within the context of the study reported here. Additionally, and from a sampling perspective, a more heterogeneous sample may benefit future research.\nPractical implications – The key insight emerging from the work is that the wide prevalence of P2P exchanges occurring globally between consumers has more to do with unexplored aspects of the phenomenon (such as its convenience; the “connectedness” it makes consumers feel to others) and seemingly much less to do with traditional marketing mix variables.\nOriginality/value – While much has been written in the practitioner ranks and popular press about the problem of P2P exchanges, this work represents one of the first empirical studies of the antecedent drivers of the phenomenon. As is articulated in the paper’s concluding sections, from a more embracing frame of reference, P2P systems and “consumer-to-consumer” exchanges are not the dire threats many marketing managers believe them to be. Challenges remain, however, for marketers to determine how to best harness these powerful new systems.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090560810903637\n|Link=https://datapro.fiu.edu/campusedge/files/articles/plouffec1711.pdf\n|Reference=Cane (2002); Schoder and Fischbach (2003); Roth (2004); Bloom (2005); Winsbury (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Thinking in broader terms about our findings and the P2P phenomenon, a transformation of a seemingly irreversible nature has occurred with the advent of P2P systems which has titled the power inherent in the exchange relationship into the consumer’s favor within key consumption categories.\n\n* The rise of P2P exchange also signals that the consumer’s unfettered acceptance of traditional consumption formats, distribution modalities, and pricing systems is waning. For example, many consumers no longer want product components which they find unappealing or wasteful (e.g. unliked songs on a music CD).\n\n* In short, P2P systems seem to have provided the technological foundation and impetus for consumers to do what anecdotal accounts have strongly signaled they have wanted to do for some time – that being to consume certain categories of goods a-la-carte, in ways which best suit their specific lifestyles and individual tastes.\n\n* From a management perspective, the implication is that media-oriented businesses (e.g. music, film, software etc.) appear stuck in the conundrum that they are legacy industries intricately linked to neoclassic economic models of exchange and distribution – and the assumptions upon which they are predicated.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Thinking more clearly about both the experiential drivers (i.e. the individual’s past experience with technology in general, and P2P systems more specifically) as well as salient individual-level perceptual constructs (e.g. the “convenience” and “community connectedness” P2P systems confer) will better enable marketers to successfully harness these powerful technologies in specific consumption modalities and industries\n(Denegri-Knott et al., 2006).\n|Description of Data=After providing an overview of the project to several large entry-level marketing classes (total n=345) at a Carnegie I research university, all interested students provided their name and a preferred email address.

The copyright industries\nare critically important to the European Community because they involve media,\ncultural, and knowledge industries. Development in the industries is indicative of\nperformance in post-industrial society especially where related to the information\nsociety.\n\nThe legal protection afforded by the relevant rights i.e. copyright and related rights\nallows for the development of a copyright industry that contributed more than €1.2\ntrillion (€1,200 billion) to the economy of the European Union, produced value added\nof €450 billion, and employed 5.2 million persons in 2000. The total gross value\nadded, which measures wealth added to the economy, represented more than 5.3 % of\nthe total value added for the 15 EU Member States. In terms of employment, the\nindustries contributed 3.1 % of total EU employment. As a result of gaps in data that\nare normally experienced when using national accounts and employment data from\nofficial international and statistical sources, a complete set of data was unavailable for\nstudy. These problems that arise as a result of these gaps in data are addressed in the\nstudy. The authors estimate that the effect of gaps in data understates the real\ncontribution of copyright to the European economy by 5 to 10 %.\nThe copyright industries are divided into 2 parts: 1) core copyright industries that are\nbased upon the creation, distribution, and sale of copyright products and services (for\nexample, magazines, motion pictures, recorded music, software), and 2) copyrightdependent\nindustries that would not exist without the existence of products and\nservices subject to copyright (for example, television set manufacturers, DVD player\nmanufacturers, computer manufacturers). Together they combine to form an overall\ncopyright industry that is among the most important contributor to the European\neconomy.\n\nThis assessment of the contribution of copyright industries to the European economy\nfocuses on the turnover, value added, and employment provided by the industries.\nTurnover provides a measure of the flow of cash into the industries before costs, value\nadded shows what wealth the industries create for the economy, and employment\nindicates the extent to which individuals and society benefit through jobs creation.\nThe core and dependent copyright industries both make significant contributions but\nthe core industries are the most important to the European economy (Figure 1).\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/etd2002b53001e34_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/studies/etd2002b53001e34_en.pdf\n|Reference=Diess (2002); European Audiovisual Observatory (2002); Manninen (2002); Siwek (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This study shows that the copyright industries are significant contributors to the economy, providing nearly 5.3 percent of total value added in the EU and 3.1 percent of total employment. The contributions of the copyright industries are far greater than many other industries that receive significant attention from policy makers.\n\n* The core copyright industries—those in which copyright content is created, processed, and distributed—are the foundation and central economic generator of European copyright industries. Across the EU, the core industries and activities create the greatest wealth evidenced in higher value added from the core sectors than the copyright-dependent activities. The core industries also provide greater employment and produce higher productivity than the dependent industries.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The authors identified a variety of categories of statistical data within the NACE classification (Nomenclature de Activités économques de la Communauté Européenne)--the general industrial classification system for the European Communities--for use in data collection activities of this research project. Several additional categories for use were identified within the CPA 2002 (classification of products by activity in the European Economic Community), and the PRODCOM (Production Communitaire) classification systems.

Journal of Cultural Economics, 34(3), 219-236.\n|Abstract=This paper examines the economic accomplishments of individual members in a Performing Rights Organization (PRO), sometimes referred to as a Performing Rights Society. Today, there is the growing importance of intellectual property and copyright protection for authors and creators of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and other intellectual works. The digital age has placed added pressure on songwriters, lyricists and composers in their ability to derive economic benefits from their intellectual creativity in the form of a copyright. Copyright laws protect and enable the creation of music by allowing authors and composers to license the control and use of their creations, and receive compensation in the form of royalty payments for their work. The PROs license, collect and distribute royalty payments for non-dramatic public performances of copyrighted musical works created and owned by its members or affiliates. In this paper, skewness and heavy tail of returns in the form of member royalty payments are estimated using the skew-normal and skew-t distributions in a parametric approach. We found strong evidence of the so-called ‘superstar effect’ in which the average royalty payment made by a PRO is still dominated by extreme outcomes, and relatively few members earned a substantial share of royalty payments from blockbuster hits that have endured over time. There is little evidence of smaller niche members dominating or replacing the ‘superstars.’ Economists and others will benefit from this empirical study which emphasizes a new understanding of the music industry from a PRO, member royalty payment and performance copyright perspective.\n|Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10824-010-9123-1\n|Reference=Anderson (2008)\n|Plain Text Proposition=Data from ASCAP on distribution of earnings.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Information Economics and Policy 24.1 (2012): 30-39.\n|Abstract=There is evidence that music piracy has differential effects on artists depending on their popularity. We present a model of music piracy with endogenous copying costs: consumers\'costs of illegal downloads increase with the scarcity of a recording and are therefore negatively related to the number of originals sold. Allowing for a second source of revenues apart from record sales, we show that piracy can hurt some artists while benefiting others. Under plausible assumptions, piracy is beneficial to the most popular artists. However, this\ndoes not carry over to less popular artists, who are often harmed by piracy. We conclude that piracy tends to reduce musical variety.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624512000030\n|Reference=Shapiro and Varian (1999); Liebowitz (1985); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2006a); Yoon (2002); Gayer and Shy (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The impact of piracy varies depending on the artist’s popularity. Our findings generalize a result found in a different setup by Gayer and Shy (2006). Like them, we show that piracy is beneficial to popular artists when side revenues are important. However, in our model this does not necessarily carry over to less popular artists: under plausible conditions on the parameters governing quality degradation and copying costs, these artists are harmed by piracy, and this can occur even when side revenues are large enough for piracy to benefit popular artists. Therefore, we have argued that piracy may be bad for social welfare since in the long run it may reduce musical variety. To conclude, let us briefly note that this negative result is mitigated when piracy, through its effect on recognition, has a positive impact on the probability of a relatively unpopular artist to become a star, as in Alcalá and González-Maestre (2010), which is likely to be the case in the presence of imperfections in the talent revelation process (Terviö, 2009, see).\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Journal of Computer Information Systems, 49(4), 84-97.\n|Abstract=Illicit music downloading is a problem for music industry groups. A rational theory of delinquency holds that actors weigh the costs and benefits before committing a deviant act. However, theory developed for physical goods may not apply to digital products. In addition, cultural products have uncertain quality prior to consumption. The intention to acquire such products may be affected by perceived quality. This paper explores the intention to illegally download music from the Internet, focusing on perceptions of quality and cost in the context of heavy downloaders and light downloaders. This study builds and tests an intention model using factors from the behavioral, economic and technological literature. The results indicate that individuals’ attitude, ability to download online music, and the price of legitimate music are the most significant factors affecting individuals’ music downloading behavior. The study finds that both price and quality is important for heavy downloaders but only price is significant for light downloaders. Implications of these findings for the music industry are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.iacis.org/jcis/jcis_toc.php?volume=49&issue=4\n|Reference=Ang et al.

Perceived equitable relationship affected the intention to download or not, but lost power to discriminate among download intensity thereafter. Attitude, Subjective Norm and Behavioral Control had no effect on intention for nondownloaders.\n\n* While downloaders may be aware that their actions are harming the owners of copyrighted music, they are still willing to download music. The findings also suggested that the current legislative efforts to deter illegal online music downloading are not effective.\n\n* The study also shows that individuals may have become accustomed to the quality of online music. There is evidence to suggest that the quality of online music no longer affects the music downloading behavior of individuals. Therefore, music industry strategies and economic models which predominantly rely on audio quality are likely to be undermined.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

We study the impact of the extensions on the production of movies. \nWe find that the extensions were associated with an increase in movie production ranging between 8.51% (±4.60%) and 10.4% (±4.89%). The increase was higher in countries where piracy was lower. \n\nThese findings were robust to various specifications, including concomitant changes in government funding of movie production. \n\nThe extension of copyright duration applied retrospectively to owners of existing film libraries and might have reduced their cost of capital. However, studios with larger libraries did not increase movie production relatively more than smaller studios. \n\nOur results suggest that contrary to received thinking among leading economists and lawyers, extensions of copyright duration far in the future did have economically significant effects on the production of movies.\n|Link=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10\n|Reference=Rappaport (1998); Liebowitz and Margolis (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The authors used data from various sources to test if the copyright extension from life + 50 to life + 70 increased movie production in 26 different OECD member states.\n\n* The authors found that, in contrast to what many leading economists had theorised,  as the copyright term was retroactively extended it did increase movie production.\n\n* The authors also found that large companies with large existing catalogues did not increase production of movies more in comparison to companies with smaller catalogues.\n\n* Found that elasticity of movie production is quite high and that during 1991-2002 there were many new production companies but the existing ones did not grow significantly during the time under study.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The authors make a distinction between four channels: buying material on physical formats in an offline or online store, paid-for downloading or streaming from a legal source, free downloading or streaming from a legal source and downloading or streaming from an illegal source. In May and June this year 3,118 members of the CentERpanel, an online household panel that is representative of the Dutch population, were invited to take part in the survey. The response rate was 64.4%, or 2,009 fully completed questionnaires.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/download/174\n|Link=http://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/download/174\n|Reference=None;\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* People who download from an illegal source are more frequently also consumers from legal sources, and they are more likely go to concerts and the cinema and to purchase derived products\n\n* Downloading of music is declining; downloading of films and series is still increasing.\n\n* There is a clear difference between music on the one hand and films & series on the other. Whereas the reported decline in downloading music is considerably greater from legal sources than from illegal sources, in the case of films and series the decrease is about the same for both sources. \n\n* The group of people who download more music from an illegal source than they used to is much smaller than the group who now download more from a legal source. The exact opposite is the case for audiovisual material.\n\n* The recent blockade of the file sharing site The Pirate Bay has had next to no effect on consumers.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

It can be implied from this that site blocking is unlikely to be effective. \n\nThe study finds that in music levels of illegal activity are falling and suggest this is a result of a wider range of services to compete with illegal sources than is presently available in other sectors. This implies that market-based solutions may be more effective than legal solutions in reducing infringing activity.\n|Description of Data=The data is drawn from a consumer survey conducted on 3,118 members aged 16 and over of the CentERpanel, an online household panel that is representative of the Dutch population.

While exports of copyright products has grown in real terms by 0.6% per year over the period 1995/96 to 2006/07, imports have grown at 2.1%. In 2006/07 Australia had a trade deficit of just under $20.8 billion in the copyright industries.  Australia’s economy has a relatively high dependence on copyright industries.  In comparison with other economies that have been analysed using the same WIPO framework as used in this report, the Australian economy appears to have a greater copyright intensity than average in terms of both value added by, and employment in, the copyright industries.\n|Authentic Link=http://web.archive.org/web/20101206161639/http://www.copyright.org.au/admin/cms-acc1/_images/13730910374c97f6ba497bf.pdf\n|Link=http://web.archive.org/web/20101206161639/http://www.copyright.org.au/admin/cms-acc1/_images/13730910374c97f6ba497bf.pdf\n|Reference=Towse (2000); Ricketson (2000); Thorpe (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Copyright industries comprise a substantial proportion of the Australian economy.

Over the period 1995/96 to 2006/07 the real (ie inflation adjusted) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the copyright industries averaged 4.7%, with the core copyright industries growing 5.1% per year. This compares to a CAGR for gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.6% over the same period.  Productivity growth in Australia’s copyright industries has resulted in significant real wages growth.  Spurred by digitisation, the value generated in Australia’s copyright industries has increased in real terms over the period 1995/96 to 2006/07 from $85,512 to $116,742 per employee. As a result, the real average wage for people employed in the copyright industries increased from\n$51,572 in 1995/96 to $61,355 in 2006/07.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

These rights include the right to copy, adapt, publish, communicate to the public and publicly perform the copyright material.  To balance the rights of copyright owners with the needs of the general public, the Copyright Act provides a number of exceptions to the general rules regarding infringement of copyright. The appropriate role and scope of these exceptions has been an ongoing matter for debate, particularly with the advent of digital copying (see ALRC 2013).\n\nConsistent with an emerging interest in better understanding the size and economic contribution of those industries which rely, to varying degrees, on copyright law, this study uses the global framework (WIPO 2003) to document the economic contribution of Australia’s copyright industries over time. Due to data classification variations, the results presented in this report differ somewhat from previous estimates.\n\nThis is the fourth copyright industries economic contribution study supported by the Australian Copyright Council (see Allen Consulting Group 2001, PwC 2008, PwC 2012).  It is important to appreciate that while the focus of this report is on the economic activity reliant to some degree on the institutional support provided by copyright law, there are a range of cultural, social and other benefits associated with the creation of copyright protected material that are not necessarily captured in the reported figures. That is, elements of copyright material - such as arts, which are seen as an important part of Australian lives - may generate benefits (e.g. cultural) that are not necessarily reflected in the market value for the goods or services (Towse 2000, p 115) ;(Australia Council 2014, p 10).\n\nIn compiling this report it is difficult to not consider the forces that have emerged to shape Australia’s copyright industries in recent years:\n#Over the period considered in this study the demand for Australia’s natural resources, principally to support the rapid growth of China, has meant that the Australian Dollar has been above its historic average value. As a consequence, imports have become cheaper, to the point that we have seen deflation across a range of imported products, and a continued decline in Australia’s copyright industry manufacturing base.\n#Many copyright products (e.g. music, movies, games, software, books, newspapers, etc) are continuing to move from physical distribution to electronic distribution, enabling the disintermediation of the supply chain (e.g. lessening the need for a physical retail presence) as consumers have shifted their consumption to digital versions and online delivery\n#There has been an increased risk of unauthorised copying because of the low cost of reproduction of perfect digital copies. Indeed the value of the production of unauthorised copyright products is not included even though they should possibly be considered part of the copyright industries.\n\nIn this changing and challenging environment there is a continued need for copyright industries to develop, supported by copyright law, which provides certainty and the incentive to innovate and grow.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Research_Papers/The_Economic_Contribution_of_Australia_s_Copyright_Industries_2002-2014.aspx\n|Link=http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Research_Papers/The_Economic_Contribution_of_Australia_s_Copyright_Industries_2002-2014.aspx\n|Reference=Towse (2000); WIPO (2003); Thorpe (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study shows that Australia’s copyright industries - many of which are undergoing significant change to their traditional business models as they continue to embrace digitisation - continue to be a key piece of infrastructure which support the Australian economy. In the most recent year for which data is available (2013-14), Australia’s copyright industries:\n*Generated economic value of $111.4 billion, the equivalent of 7.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is greater than the manufacturing and health care sectors. \n\nWhile still significant, growth in Australia’s copyright industries has been challenged in recent years:\n*Over the period 2001-02 to 2007-08 the real (i.e. inflation adjusted) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for value add generated by copyright industries was 3.7 per cent, with the core copyright industries growing 3.2 per cent per year.\n* Over the subsequent period 2008-09 to 2013-14 the real value add CAGR for all copyright industries was zero per cent, and 0.3 per cent for the core copyright industries.\n*Employed just over 1 million people, which constituted 8.7 per cent of the Australian workforce. On average, copyright industry jobs are relatively well paid: the real average wage for people employed in the copyright industries has also increased from $59,500 in 2004-05 to $68,960 per employee in 2013-14 .\n*Generated just over $4.8 billion in exports, equal to 1.8 per cent of total exports. The relative value of copyright exports has declined as a proportion of total exports in recent years.\nIn this regard, Australia’s copyright industries continue to be a significant contributor to the Australian economy and our current and future national prosperity.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The ALRC’s recommendation in favour of fair use is based predominantly on a legal analysis and did not include an economic cost-benefit analysis (CBA). From an economic perspective it is clear that they may be new disincentives to create works with the introduction of a 'fair use' provision. As a result, the core task of this analysis is to determine, based on the available evidence, whether it is likely that the economic benefits arising from secondary use will more than offset the economic loss for original local producers. This report provides some insights into elements that should be considered in any formal CBA of the proposed introduction of fair use.\n\nDisclaimer: This Report was prepared for APRA AMCOS, PPCA, Copyright Agency│Viscopy, Foxtel, News Corp Australia and Screenrights.

The resulting loss of economies of scale would lead to an increase in transaction costs, compliance costs and enforcement costs.\nBoth quantitative analyses suggest that there is no firm evidence supporting a direct causational relationship between fair use and improved economic outcomes for the Australian economy as a whole; the linkages between economic growth and innovation are likely a confluence of factors that interact to support a country’s economic outcomes.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The research arose primarily from the recommendations of the Hargreaves Review which was quite explicit in pointing to orphan works as a major problem of untapped resources in the UK.  \n\nWithin this context the aims of the study were to carry out some qualitative research in the UK\nwith organisations that had an interest in orphan works and had previously been consulted by\nIPO. The main aim was to consult on the views of interested parties and in particular discuss\nthe perceived benefits, disbenefits, and changes in use patterns from their perspective.  In parallel with this research, IPO has commissioned further research on the use of orphan works schemes and pricing issues which has been carried out by Bournemouth University.\n\nAt the time of the research the details of potential proposals to be put forward by the Government\nfor an orphan works scheme were not known in full, but there had been consultations as part of\nthe Hargreaves Review and subsequently. Hence the results are qualified by this, and need to\nbe viewed in this context.\n|Authentic Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/orphan-works-in-the-uk-and-overseas\n|Link=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/orphan-works-in-the-uk-and-overseas\n|Plain Text Proposition=The interviews with organisations in the UK showed that by and large they supported the introduction of an orphan works system. The small group that did not, considered that it would be too costly to administer, and that the costs would outweigh the benefits. There were considered to be benefits in terms of the competitiveness of businesses, especially for the smaller ones (where the cost of accessing material would be reduced, coupled with an increase in the supply) and firms in the media, TV, film and publicity sectors. Hence, there could be wider economic benefits and some stimulation of growth. The main benefits to society were considered to be increased access to materials, training and educational benefits. The disbenefits were potentially that the system could be too complex and cumbersome, and licenses could take too long to be issued. It was considered that there would be an increase in demand for orphan work material.\n\nThe main economic benefits were considered to be increases in competitiveness, income and\nrevenue, especially for the media sector. The main benefits to society were through the increase\nin access to material which improved education and training, and the choice of services for the\npublic.\n\nOverseas organisations did not identify many disbenefits. The main ones were that the process\nto obtain use could take too long, and the system could be complex. The issue of legal\nchallenges was not raised as a disbenefit. The orphan works systems had increased the supply of useable materials primarily because of a reduced risk of copyright infringement, and greater certainty and confidence. There was very little difference in the perceived benefits and disbenefits of systems overseas, as compared to the potential UK system, based on the perceptions of the organisations in these countries.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

(2011). Olson’s Paradox Revisited: An Empirical Analysis of Incentives to Contribute in P2P File-sharing Communities (No. 201105). Center for Research in Economics and Management (CREM), University of Rennes 1, University of Caen and CNRS.\n|Abstract=This article aims to examine how the size of file-sharing communities affects their functioning and performance (i.e. their capacity to share content). Olson (1965) argued that small communities are more able to provide collective goods. Using an original database on BitTorrent file-sharing communities, our article finds a positive relationship between the size of a community and the amount of collective goods provided. But, the individual incentives to contribute slightly decrease with community size. These results seem to indicate that Peer to Peer file-sharing communities provide a pure (non rival) public good. We also show that specialised communities are more efficient than general communities to promote cooperative behaviour. Finally, the rules designed by the administrators of these communities play an active role to manage voluntary contributions and improve file-sharing performance.\n|Link=http://crem.univ-rennes1.fr/wp/2011/201105.pdf\n|Reference=Olson (1965); Asvanund, Clay, Krishnan and Smith (2004); Krishnan, Smith, Tang and Telang (2007); Zhang and Zhu (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* The collective provision in these P2P communities can be analysed as a pure public good. \n\n* The amount of collective good increases with the number of registered users whereas the individual propensity to contribute decreases with community enlargement.\n\n* Specialised communities seem to encourage voluntary contribution. Moreover, the catalog of content tends to be larger in specialised communities.\n\n* A community that relies on public search engine to promote its catalog (an advertised community) has a higher proportion of contributors, but a more limited catalog of content.\n\n* The rules designed by the administrators of these communities have a significant impact on their performance and their sustainable size. We find that stricter monitoring schemes have a positive impact on the incentives to contribute. \n\n* The amount of unique files shared is lower in a private community. The provision of a large catalog (or a long tail) of contents that match individual preferences cannot be disconnected from the design and management of these virtual communities.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The method of analysis is economic rather than legal. The report reviews the basic economic principals involved in copyright law and gives rough estimates of the value of copyrights on books, music, and movies produced in the 1920s and 1930s — those that would be most immediately affected by an extension of copyright terms. Likely marketplace effects of imposing a user fee are also outlined. This report will not be updated.

The InfoSoc Directive introduced minimum levels of copyright protection without setting standards for the protection of the public’s and users’ interests. As a consequence, the implementation of the InfoSoc Directive has not led to the EU-wide harmonisation of copyright sought by many parties. In particular, the optional nature of most copyright exceptions and limitations and the failure to limit the scope of protection of copyright and related rights to those outlined in the directive, has led to continuing fragmentation of national copyright laws among Member States.\nThe Commission’s consultation on the copyright reform provides a thorough picture of the change of context of copyright in the digital age, and reveals the most pressing problems met by many stakeholders in their everyday usage of copyright.\n|Link=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A8-2015-0209+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN\n|Reference=Dobusch and Quack (2012); Heald (2013); Buccafusco and Heald (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The fragmentation of EU copyright law and the resulting lack of transparency are well understood by the Commission, and are reflected in the Commission’s intention to break down ‘national silos’ in copyright legislation. A particularly pressing issue in this regard is the optional nature of the exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights.\n\n* One of the main objectives of the Digital Single Market should be removing territorial restrictions and encouraging pan-European accessibility of services. Such progress can be deemed integral and inherent to the notion of a Digital Single Market and is an important step towards fostering innovation and competitiveness of European businesses.  \n\n* However, the vast majority of end-user respondents report face problems when trying to access online services across the Member States, particularly where technological protection measures are used to enforce territorial restrictions.\n\n* It is therefore necessary to develop a legal context that improves the negotiating position of creators in their contractual relationships, and to put in place pro-competitive measures, such as net neutrality and the encouragement of open formats.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Thus, at the outset of the negotiations that led to  the formation of the Berne Convention in 1884, the distinguished Swiss delegate Numa Droz  stated that it should be remembered that “limits to absolute protection are rightly set by the  public interest.”2  In consequence, from the original Berne Act of 1886,3 the Berne  Convention has contained provisions granting latitude to member states to limit the rights of  authors in certain circumstances.  In keeping with this approach, the present international  conventions on authors’ and related rights contain a mixture of limitations and exceptions on  protection that may be adopted under national laws.  These can be grouped, very roughly,  under the following headings:\n\n1.  Provisions that exclude, or allow for the exclusion of, protection for particular  categories of works or material.  \n\n2. Provisions that allow for the giving of immunity (usually on a permissive, rather than  mandatory, basis) from infringement proceedings for particular kinds of use, for example,  where this is for the purposes of news reporting or education, or where particular conditions  are satisfied. \n\n3. By provisions that allow a particular use of copyright material, subject to the payment  of compensation to the copyright owner. \n\nThe juridical and policy basis for each kind of provision is different.  The first proceeds  on the assumption that there are clear public policy grounds that copyright protection should  not exist in the works in question, for example, because of the importance of the need for  ready availability of such works from the point of view of the general public.  The second  represents a more limited concession that certain kinds of uses of works that are otherwise  protected should be allowed:  there is a public interest present here that justifies overriding the  private rights of authors in their works in these particular circumstances.  In the third category  of cases, the author’s rights continue to be protected but are significantly abridged:  public  interest still justifies the continuance of the use, regardless of the author’s consent, but subject  to the payment of appropriate remuneration.  Instances of all three kinds of provisions are to  be found in each of the conventions that are the subject of the present study, although they are  most developed in the case of the Paris Act of Berne.  For the most part, they are not made  mandatory, but are left as matters for the national legislation of member states to determine  for themselves, albeit usually within strict boundaries that are set by the provision in question.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

We collect new data on albums obtained via purchase and downloading, as well as consumers’ valuations of these albums, among a sample of U.S. college students in 2003. We provide new estimates of sales displacement induced by downloading, using both ordinary least squares and an instrumental variables approach with access to broadband as a source of exogenous variation in downloading. We find that each album download reduces purchases by about .2 in our sample, although possibly by much more. Our valuation data allow us to measure the effects of downloading on welfare as well as expenditure in a subsample of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates, and we find that downloading reduces their per capita expenditure (on hit albums released 1999–2003) from $126 to $101 but raises per capita consumers’ surplus by $70.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/430809\n|Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.505.4843&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Reference=Varian (2000); Zentner (2003); Liebowitz (2003); Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Successfully measuring the possible sales-displacing effect of unpaid music downloading requires data on the quantities of purchases and downloads made by individuals.\n\n* In the case of the individuals in the sample, downloading reduced expenditure by about 10 percent but possibly by much more. \n\n* Downloaded music is valued much less than purchased music. Results indicate that downloaded albums tend to be low valued, which suggests that the harm done by downloading is limited.\n\n* Downloading reduces expenditure (on hit albums, 1999–2003) by $25 per capita in the subsample. \n\n* A direct welfare analysis of downloading suggests it raises sample consumers’ welfare associated with these albums by $70 per capita.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

A variety of crosssectional and longitudinal empirical approaches show large and\nstatistically significant evidence of displacement. In the most appropriate empirical specification, we find that unpaid first consumption reduces paid consumption by about 1 unit. Unpaid second consumption has a smaller effect, about 0.20 units. Our analysis indicates that unpaid consumption, which makes up 5.2 per cent of movie viewing in our sample, reduced paid consumption in our sample by 3.5 per cent.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6451.2007.00316.x/full\n|Reference=Varian (2000); Zentner (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of the study relate to:\n\n# The rate of displacement caused by piracy: the number of movies are not purchased for each movie that is pirated.\n# The amount of displacement: the amount of  paid consumption displaced by unpaid consumption.\n\nThe main results of the study are as follows:\n\n* The overall finding is that, although the rate of displacement is large (1.0), the amount of displacement is small. Only a small fraction of consumption in our sample, 5.2%, is unpaid consumption. \n\n* Paralleling this movie revenues have grown significantly (39%) over the last four years, and the bulk of this increase is attributed to DVD sales (despite the fact that DVD sales suffer the most from piracy). \n\n* The rate of displacement we have estimated is sufficiently high that piracy continues to be a serious concern as the technologies allowing unpaid consumption improve and diffuse widely.\n\n* The ''large rate'' of displacement coupled with ''low amount'' of displacement finding of the study differs significantly from the authors' previous research on the music industry. In music the pattern is reversed: low rate of displacement accompanying the high volume of unpaid music consumption.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

In each survey, students see a list of the top 50 movies fromeach of the previous three years (2002–2004 in spring 2005, and 2003–2005 year to date in fall 2005). For each movie they are asked whether they saw it, as well as the sequence by which they saw it. Respondents can have seen a movie by any (and any combination) of 4 paid methods: theater, television, rental, and purchase; as well as by either or both of two unpaid methods: by viewing a downloaded copy, or by viewing a burned copy of a legally obtained copy (generally DVD). For each movie seen, a respondent enters a ‘1’ under the mode they first saw it, a ‘2’ under the mode by which they saw it next (if they saw it more than once), and so on.\n\nIn addition to asking about their movie consumption, the survey also asks about family income, respondent’s race and age, speed of Internet access, and three variables related to their interest in movies: how often they go to movie theaters, howmany movies they own, and their (self-reported) level of interest in movies on a five-point scale. The sample includes nearly 21,000 instances of movie consumption.\n|Data Year=2005\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Longitudinal Study, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Correlation and Association, Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Film and motion pictures;\n|Country=USA;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=470\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=2002-2005\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1409, 'title': 'Roark (2010)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Roark (2010)\n|Author=Roark, M.L.\n|Title=Limitation of Sales Warranties as an Alternative to Intellectual Property Rights: An Empirical Analysis of IPhone Warranties’ Deterrent Impact on Consumers\n|Year=2010\n|Full Citation=Roark, M.L.

Its success has revealed a community of hackers that have attempted to circumvent the exclusive arrangement that Apple shares with AT&T for cellular telephone service. Unfortunately for Apple (and similarly situated manufacturers), intellectual property doctrines and laws do not prevent consumers from altering their products so as to circumvent relationships that manufacturers may have with others. Manufacturers inevitably lose capacity to control the product as a result of the sale of specific units. The doctrines of first sale in both patent and copyright law prevent manufacturers from controlling consumer manipulation of the object after the sale has been completed. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention provision does not necessarily apply to prevent consumers from altering firmware within a product. Manufacturers are increasingly turning to alternatives to intellectual property to secure control over the device after the sale. One such alternative is the exclusion of warranty under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for aberrant consumers.\n\nThis article considers whether limitation of warranties may actually have the deterrence effect on consumers that manufacturers desire; said differently, the article weighs whether manufacturers can achieve their goals of preventing consumers from using their products in an unauthorized manner by removing warranty protections from the consumer. The Article presents a behavioral model based on the Triandis' model of planned behavior and enhances the model by accounting for likely and unlikely benefits and detriments. The model suggests that participants weigh the detrimental impact together with the probability and magnitude of the detriment against the beneficial impact together with the probability and magnitude of the benefit when making the decision to engage in technological piracy. Considering only half of the equation - what deterrents are likely to impact consumer behavior - the Article then reconciles the model to empirical evidence suggesting that Apple's warranty could be a stronger deterrent for consumers than civil liability.\n\nThe data collected suggests four observations of the survey pool: (1) known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy; (2) persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy; (3) a better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty's benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability; and (4) the magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved. The article concludes that manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use.\n|Authentic Link=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dltr/vol9/iss1/17/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1351967\n|Reference=Lessig (2002); Gopal and Sanders (1997); Cheng et al (1997); Limayem et al (1997);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy. \n* Persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy.\n* A better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty's benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability\n* The magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This study examines the individual characteristics of downloaders which could explain why they are not dissuaded by messages that downloading is illegal. We compared downloaders to non-downloaders and examined whether downloaders were characterized by less ethical concern, engagement in illegal behaviour, and a propensity toward stealing a CD from a music store under varying levels of risk. We also examined whether downloading or individual characteristics of downloaders were similar for men and women. Findings revealed downloading was prevalent (74.5% of the student sample downloaded), men and women were equally likely to download and the factors characterizing downloading were similar for men and women. The comparison between downloaders and non-downloaders revealed downloaders were less concerned with the law, demonstrated by less ethical concern and engagement in other illegal behaviours. Downloaders were also more likely to indicate that they would steal a CD when there was no risk of being caught. Given these results, messages regarding illegality are unlikely to perturb downloaders and alternative recommendations are offered for targeting illegal downloading.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-1079-3\n|Reference=Al-Rafee and Cronan (2006); Cronan and Al-Rafee (2008); International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Downloading music is prevalent. 74.5% of the sampled students downloaded music.\n\n* The factors characterizing downloading are similar for men and women.

The study demonstrated that downloaders had less ethical concern, and engaged in other illegal behaviours.\n\n* Generally, neither downloaders nor non-downloaders were likely to steal a CD, whether there was a risk of being caught or not. However, 20% of downloaders were significantly more likely than non-downloaders to indicate that they would steal a CD when there was no risk of being caught.\n\n* Some downloading is predicted by the belief that no harm is being committed. A lack of ethical concern regarding consumer behaviour in general, rather than ethical attitudes toward pirating specifically, is also associated with downloading.\n\n* Deterrent messages saying that downloading is illegal, or comparing downloading to stealing a CD, are unlikely to deter downloading.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This study suggests that downloading and music piracy might already be causing a more general erosion of ethics in society, and might possibly be a precursor to more serious illegal acts.\n|Description of Data=Field survey data from questionnaires completed by a self-selecting sample of 196 young students (93 males and 103 females) at a New Zealand university (2010)\n\nThe sample was representative of typical first year students from a range of study areas, and not limited by socio-economic, gender or ethnic differences.\n|Data Year=None\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=New Zealand;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None;\n|Sample Size=196\n|Level of Aggregation=Sub-institutional;\n|Data Material Year=Time period of material is not stated in the study, which is about contemporary attitudes to piracy of software generally in use, and thus can be inferred to be early C21st, or to be the survey date, which is itself not explicitly stated, but can be inferred to be 2010.\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=196\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=None\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1237, 'title': 'Rochelandet and Le Guel (2005)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Rochelandet and Le Guel (2005)\n|Author=Rochelandet, F.;Le Guel, F.\n|Title=P2P music sharing networks: Why the legal fight against copiers may be inefficient\n|Year=2005\n|Full Citation=Rochelandet, F., & Le Guel, F.

In accordance with the prediction of the Beckerian framework, copying behavior is negatively correlated with the willingness to pay for an original when a copy is available. But individuals also make their decisions according to their social neighborhood and to the degree to which they have learned about copying. Furthermore, we find that copiers are motivated by the search for diversified contents, and they are also very concerned about the interests of artists. We then consider the efficiency of anti-copying policies on the copying of music and movies.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/PIP_Journal.cfm?pip_jrnl=881114\n|Link=http://facultynh.syr.edu/bjsheeha/Research%20Projects/music%20download%20research/music%20download%20project/articles%20for%20music%20download/rochelandet2005.pdf\n|Reference=Banerjee (1992); Schiller (1995); Kretschemer et al.

It depends on the sensitivity of current users — particularly, ’fashion leaders’ — to such signals. This study suggests that the perception of legal risks is not significant.\n\n* More generally, P2P sharing is only a small part of copying behavior: it is mainly grounded on more general copying practices. Unauthorized sharing is primarily embedded in social networks: family, friends and office. In other words, file-sharing and physical exchanges of CD and MP3 files. Therefore, fighting only P2P is not only insufficient to eradicate file sharing in the long run but also somewhat iniquitous.\n\n* P2P users search for a certain level of access to diversity of works. In comparison with P2P supply, the current models of online delivery such as iTunes seem to suffer from a lack of cultural diversity.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Half of the participants were subjected to an “enforcement campaign” condition that indicated the enforcement crackdown on digital piracy. The other half did not receive information about enforcement of digital copyright infringement. Results indicate that regardless of explicit campaign enforcement,Chinese students’ inclination to engage in digital piracy hinges chiefly on the perceived behavior and approval of others. This stands in contrast to the US students for whom the enforcement campaign changed influences on their behavior. Both social norms and perceived deterrence affected decisionmaking during the explicit crackdown, whereas both social norms and perceived duty to obey the law affected decision-making when there is no explicit crackdown.

The copyright system in the UK is undergoing a gradual process of reform to reflect this new reality. \nIn 2006, Andrew Gowers, a former editor of the Financial Times, presented a report into the state of intellectual property in the U.K. Among his policy recommendations were three proposed changes to the copyright exceptions system which alter the way in which consumers can interact with copyrighted works. Gowers proposed introducing copyright exceptions for:\n\n* Format shifting, for instance the transfer of a piece of music from a CD to an mp3 player.\n\n* Parody, caricature and pastiche.\n\n* Creative, transformative or derivative works. In our context, this definition includes user-generated content.\n\nOur review examines the existing literature on the possible economic effects of these proposed changes to the copyright exceptions system, specifically whether the introduction of these proposed changes would cause economic damage to rights-holders. Whilst the economic issues surrounding copyright infringement via file-sharing and commercial "mash-ups" are interesting and important, our review is focused solely on copyright.\n|Authentic Link=http://oro.open.ac.uk/25604/\n|Link=http://oro.open.ac.uk/25604/5/The_economics_of_consumer_copyright_exceptions_final.pdf\n|Reference=Lessig (2008); Econlaw (2007); Nathan Associates (2006); Gowers (2006); CLRA (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*  A creator automatically extracts value from copyright exceptions, since these directly influence the demand for the original creative work\n\n*  The two most commonly cited economic studies into the effects of Private Copying Remuneration (PCR) systems – Econlaw (2007) and Nathan Associates (2006) – do not provide any useful evidence that consumer copyright exceptions cause economic damage to rights-holders, or that a copyright levy is justified on these grounds.\n\n* The economic evidence that format-shifting, parody and user-generated content cause any kind of economic damage to rights-holders simply does not exist.\n\n* Arguments that support tighter copyright law, or support PCR systems, tend to confuse economic damage with consumer value. Any future analysis on this issue needs to investigate the conditions under which the proposed consumer copyright exceptions would have any impact on demand for creative work.\n\n* Many countries have now introduced a levy on blank media and digital storage hardware.\n\n* It is not appropriate to claim that increased consumer value derived from the interaction of copyrighted works and new technology is damaging either to artists now, or decreases their incentive to supply creative works.

(2014). Copyright Trolling, An Empirical Study. Iowa Law Review, Forthcoming.\n|Abstract=This detailed empirical and doctrinal study of copyright trolling presents new data showing the astonishing rate of growth of multi-defendant John Doe litigation in United States district courts over the past decade. It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases filed.\n\nThis Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the extant literature on copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be counted as part of copyright trolling whenever these suits are motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls are inapt because they do not account for what is now the most widely practiced from of trolling.\n\nIn addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article explores the features of copyright doctrine that have facilitated the recent explosion in trolling litigation in the form of litigation against John Does. In particular, it shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe (MDJD) litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model.\n|Authentic Link=http://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404950\n|Reference=Balganesh (2013); Polonsky (2012); Wu (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study:\n\n*We are currently witnessing an explosion of copyright trolling in U.S. federal district courts. \n\n*Copyright trolling in the form of MDJD lawsuits has grown rapidly over the last decade and much of the growth has taken place in the last four years. \n\n*The data also shows that MDJD litigation is dominated by claims of infringement relating to pornographic films. \n\n*What little attention has been paid to copyright trolls has largely focused on Righthaven and similar examples — these previous studies have missed the core of the copyright troll phenomenon.\n\n*The opportunism of copyright trolls is primarily directed towards statutory damages. As the Righthaven example shows, statutory damages can make the pursuit of otherwise inconsequential infringements extremely profitable, more profitable than licensing those uses in advance could ever have been. \n\n*As the MDJD cases show, statutory damages stack the deck in favor of the plaintiff such that the underlying liability of the defendant is effectively irrelevant to the settlement calculation.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Monetizing infringement is perfectly legal, but unlike the pursuit of deterrence and compensation it is very hard to square with the motivating purpose of copyright law: promoting social progress.\n\n*Reform proposals include: reasonable statutory damages; denying joinder and severing cases; conditional joinder and other safeguards.\n|Description of Data=The author created a database that includes all copyright cases filed in the all federal district courts circuits between January 1, 2001 and March 31, 2014\n|Data Year=2014\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Structural Equation Modeling\n|Industry=Film and motion pictures;\n|Country=United States;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=None stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=42900\n|Level of Aggregation=Copyright cases filed in US District Courts,\n|Data Material Year=January 2001 to June 30, 2014\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1405, 'title': 'Sag (2012)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Sag (2012)\n|Author=Sag, M.\n|Title=Predicting Fair Use\n|Year=2012\n|Full Citation=Sag, M. (2012). Predicting fair use. Ohio State Law Journal, 73, 1.\n|Abstract=Fair use is often criticized as unpredictable and doctrinally incoherent - a conclusion which necessarily implies that the copyright system is fundamentally broken. This article confronts that critique by systematically assessing the predictability of fair use outcomes in litigation. Concentrating on characteristics of the contested use that would be apparent to litigants pre-trial, this study tests a number of doctrinal assumptions, claims and intuitions that have not, until now, been subject to empirical scrutiny.\n\nThis article presents new empirical evidence for the significance of transformative use in determining the outcomes of fair use cases. It also substantially undermines conceptions of the doctrine that are hostile to fair use claims by commercial entities and that would restrict limit the application of fair use as a subsidy or a redistributive tool favoring the politically and economically disadvantaged. Based on the available evidence, the fair use doctrine is more rational and consistent than is commonly assumed.\n|Authentic Link=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/\n|Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1769130\n|Reference=Leval (1990); Lessig (2004); Beebe (2008); Samuelson (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of the study:\n\n*The evidence from litigated cases analyzed in the article confirms the centrality of transformative use.\n\n*Transformative use by the defendant is a robust predictor of a finding of fair use.\n\n*The results of this study also confirm the significance of the statutory factor that addresses “the amount and substantiality” of the defendant’s unauthorized use of the plaintiff’s work. Although the effect is not as large as was transformative use, there is clear evidence confirming that partial copying weighs in favor of the defendant’s assertion of fair use. \n\n*It is also apparent from the data that there are many strong cases of fair use involving copying the entirety of the plaintiff’s work. Technologies that rely on digital processing of entire copyrighted works, such as Internet search engines and plagiarism detection software, nonetheless present a very strong case for fair use.\n\n*There is no evidence that commercial use (in contrast to direct commercial use) reduces the defendant’s chance of maintaining a fair use defense. \n\n*Regression analysis of the effect of party status variables on the probability of a finding of fair use either failed to find the predicted underdog effect or found exactly the opposite.\n\n*This study offers considerable evidence against the oft-repeated assertion that fair use adjudication is blighted by unpredictability and doctrinal incoherence.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

This article empirically establishes that judicial decision making in relation to IP is significantly and predictably shaped by judicial ideology. Using data drawn from Supreme Court intellectual property cases decided in between 1954 and 2006, we show that ideology is a significant determinant of cases involving intellectual property rights. However, our analysis also shows that there are significant differences between intellectual property and other areas of the law with respect to the effect of ideology. This analysis has important implications for the study of intellectual property. It also contributes to the broader judicial ideology literature by demonstrating the effect of ideology in economic cases.\n|Authentic Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=997963\n|Reference=Segal (1997); Hall and Ziedonis (2001); Moore (2001); Epstein and King (2002); Quinn (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article explores whether the outcomes of intellectual property cases are determined by judicial ideology – as measured on the traditional liberal-conservative scale. Political science’s ‘attitudinal school’ – developing the legal realist claim that judges vote their political preferences, or attitudes – have shown that ideology is a significant,TPFPT and arguably the dominant, determinant of judicial decisions generally. More specifically, it shows that:\n\n* Correcting the erroneous impression that intellectual property is not shaped by judicial ideology is important for IP (Intellectual Property) scholarship, but it also provides a vital answer to a largely unanswered question in the broader judicial ideology literature, of whether ideology shapes economic cases as well as salient social-political issues. \n\n* The types of IP involved in a case are also a significant determinant of the probability that the justices will vote for (or against) the IP owner.\n\n* Although we can resoundingly reject the notion that IP is immune to the effects of ideological division, there is evidence that IP is different to other areas of the law. There is a significant difference between the extent to which ideology shapes IP cases and the extent to which it affects other areas of the law.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2015). IP Litigation in United States District Courts: 1994 to 2014. Available at SSRN 2570803.\n|Abstract=This article undertakes a broad-based empirical review of Intellectual Property (IP) litigation in United States federal district courts from 1994 to 2014. Unlike the prior literature, this study analyzes federal copyright, patent and trademark litigation trends as a unified whole. It undertakes a systematic analysis of more than 190,000 individual case filings and examines the subject matter, geographical and temporal variation within federal IP litigation over the last two decades. \n\nThis article makes a number of significant contributions to our understanding of IP litigation. It analyzes time trends in copyright, patent and trademark litigation filings at the national level, but it does much more than simply count the number of cases; it explores the meaning behind those numbers and shows how in some cases the observable headline data can be positively misleading. Exploring the changes in the distribution of IP litigation over time and their regional distribution leads to a number of significant insights, these are summarized below. Just as importantly, one of the key contributions of this article is that it frames the context for more fine-grained empirical studies in the future. Many of the results and conclusions herein demonstrate the dangers of basing empirical conclusions on narrow slices of data from selected regions or selected time periods.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2570803\n|Reference=Priest and Klien (1984); Landes (2004); Hoffman, Izenma, and Lidicker (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* First, the rise of Internet file-sharing has transformed copyright litigation in the United States. More specifically, to the extent that the rate of copyright litigation has increased over the last two decades, that increase appears to be entirely attributable to lawsuits against anonymous Internet file sharers. These lawsuits largely took place in two distinct phases: the first phase largely consisted of lawsuits seeking to discourage illegal downloading; the second phase largely consists lawsuits seeking to monetize online infringement. \n* Second, in relation to patent litigation, the apparent patent litigation explosion between 2010 and 2012 is something of a mirage; however there has been a sustained patent litigation inflation over the last two decades the extent of which has not been fully recognized until now. The reason why this steady inflation was mistaken for a sudden explosion was that the true extent of patent litigation was disguised by permissive joinder.\n* Third, in relation to the geography of IP litigation, it appears that filings in copyright, patent and trademark litigation are generally highly correlated. The major exceptions to that correlation are driven by short term idiosyncratic events in copyright and trademark litigation — these are discussed in detail — and by the dumbfounding willingness of the Eastern district Texas to engage in forum selling to attract patent litigation. The popularity of the Eastern District of Texas as a forum for patent litigation is a well-known phenomenon. However, the data and analysis presented in this study provides a new way of looking at the astonishing ascendancy of this district and the problem of form shopping in patent law more generally.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Technovation, 27(6), 325-334.\n|Abstract=During the last years music sales had sharply declined. According to the recording industry, one of the reasons for this decline is the development of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The main goal of this research was to establish a relationship between consumer attitudes and the P2P music consumption proportion. We identified a set of characteristics of P2P networks that could explain the proportion of P2P music compared to Compact Disc (CD) music and we observed on a sample of 4060 Spanish P2P users the impact each of those characteristics had on the CD-purchasing behaviour of these users. Results show how price, assortment and discovery of the P2P music consumption process were related to higher proportions of P2P music.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497207000053\n|Reference=Bhattacharjee, Gopal and Sanders (2003); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2004); Rob and Waldfogel (2004); Blackburn (2004); Liebowitz (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Willingness to pay is a relevant factor in the P2P/CD proportion decision of the P2P user. The study revealed that Spanish P2P users with a lower proportion of CD music are mainly motivated by price.\n\n* The availability of a wide assortment of products and products that are difficult to find on CD format appears to be a significant factor in the decision ro use P2P over CD. This factor could not only be an important advantage of P2P music compared to CD music, but also a reason to migrate consumption from CD stores to Online stores with catalogues of more than one million songs.\n\n* The facility to discover "new" music drives the move towards P2P from CD. By using P2P networks, music consumers have an improved experience, either by themselves through a trial–error process, or with the help of some other members of the P2P community.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

After 10 weeks, 4460 individuals completed correctly the survey, for a response rate of 21.51%. The average respondent took 1 min to complete the questionnaire.\n\nMost of the P2P networks users were male (56%), between 18 and 24 years old (74%) and with less than 15,000 euros income (76%). Very few, just the 8.4% declared having bought music at online stores. The average price a Spanish P2P user would like to pay for online music was 0.46 euros/song, less than a half the normal price of 0.99 euros/song music consumers can find in the online music stores in Spain.

Based on a sample of more than 4000 Spanish P2P users, the empirical research reveals how a perceived greater value and a more intensive prosecution policy of copyright violations will boost their willingness to pay for online music.\n|Authentic Link=http://con.sagepub.com/content/13/1/63.short\n|Link=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.94.8045&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n|Reference=Bhattacharjee, Gopal and Sanders (2003); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2004); Rob and Waldfogel (2004); Liebowitz (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Two-thirds of the P2P users surveyed, 69 per cent, said that they would pay for online music, while just 31 per cent revealed that they would never pay for it.\n\n* The average price a Spanish P2P user  would pay for a digital song is 68 cents of a euro (roughly US$0.75), which is 30 per cent lower than the current price of 99 cents of a euro set by most digital music providers in Spain.\n\n* 41 per cent of the potential payers for online music felt that increased prosecution of illegal downloading is also a good motivation to pay for online music.\n\n* Very few Spanish P2P users had ethical convictions about downloading music with regard to the impact on artists: this finding was especially evident among female users.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The likely effectiveness of harsher laws is also supported by our research; we found that on average P2P users who are more afraid of legal prosecution tend to download fewer songs."\n\n* The survey confirmed that very few Spanish P2P users had ethical convictions about downloading music with regard to the impact on artists...more effective publicity campaigns (institutional and commercial) are needed to inculcate more P2P users with ‘downloading ethics’."\n|Description of Data=This study appears to draw on the same survey data as Sandulli (2007) but reaches a different conclusion on the average price a Spanish P2P user would like to pay for online music. This study states the average P2P user would be willing to pay 0.68 Euros/song whereas Sandulli (2007) states the figure as being 0.46 Euros/song.\n\nAn initial sample of 20,573 P2P users was identified and emailed an online survey. After 10 weeks, 4460 individuals completed correctly the survey, for a response rate of 21.51%. The average respondent took 1 min to complete the questionnaire.\n\nThe survey asks questions relating to: Gender, Age, Income, Willingness to Pay, Downloading Activity, \n\nMost of the P2P networks users were male (56%), between 18 and 24 years old (74%) and with less than 15,000 euros income (76%). Very few, just the 8.4% declared having bought music at online stores. The average price a Spanish P2P user would like to pay for online music was 0.68 euros/song compared with the normal price of 0.99 euros/song music consumers can find in the online music stores in Spain.

And its success is due in no small part to its ability to temper our individual initiative and creativity with our commitment to participate in a positive way in a worldwide conversation.\n\n* But We have changed from sending notices with one or two takedown requests to sending thousands of notices with millions of requests to service providers.\n\n* With this comes a lack oftransparency about arrangements for automated submission and processing of “mega” notices, and of incessant user failure to respond to and correct abusive and erroneous takedowns.\n\n* In order to improve the situations, all notices by all reporters should be treatied fairly and equally. Infringing content should be accurately detected and removed with precision.

A., Chen, Y. C., & Chen, P. C. (2008). Ethical decisions about sharing music files in the P2P environment. Journal of Business Ethics, 80(2), 349-365.\n|Abstract=Digitized information and network have made an enormous impact on the music and movie industries. Internet piracy is popular and has greatly threatened the companies in these industries. This study tests Hunt-Vitell’s ethical decision model and attempts to understand why and how people share unauthorized music files with others in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The norm of anti-piracy, the ideology of free software, the norm of reciprocity, and the ideology of consumer rights are proposed as four deontological norms related to using P2P systems. The model is tested using a scenario survey with four alternatives; the results indicate that the deontological norm of anti-piracy is not a main factor in affecting P2P users’ ethical considerations regarding sharing files with others. This finding suggests that to protect their property rights, record companies should try to realize the consumer benefits brought via new digital and network technology, instead of simply declaring their intellectual property and resisting the innovations resulting from new technologies.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/article/10.1007/s10551-007-9424-2\n|Reference=Hunt and Vitell (1986); Bhattacharjee, Gopal and Sanders (2003); Liebowitz (2006); Vitell (2003);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results reported in this study:\n\n*This study tested the Hunt–Vitell model to explore the impacts of multiple norms on users’ ethical decisions about variant ways of using the P2P network to share copyrighted music files.\n\n*The results show that deontological evaluations are influenced by the belief in the ideology of consumer rights in all alternatives, and its impacts are larger than most of the other antecedents. Consumer rights may be the major and general cause for sharing music files in the P2P network.\n\n*The norm of reciprocity and the ideology of freeware can also motive people to use a free P2P system to sharing music files, but their using free P2P systems is discouraged by their belief in the norm of anti-piracy.\n\n*There are several reasons for the weak impact of the belief in the norm of anti-piracy. First, paying the P2P provider may transfer guilt and the problem of piracy to the P2P system provider. People may believe they are doing a good thing for both musicians and consumers by distributing good music, instead of hurting copyright holders. The large numbers on a P2P network and the anonymity of a computer-mediated environment may also create ethical ambiguity and lead to deindividuation. This leads to the negative effects of decreasing self- awareness and stimulating anti-normative behavior.\n\n*The Hunt–Vitell model suggests that when behavior and intentions are inconsistent with ethical judgments, one of the consequences will be guilt (Hunt and Vitell, 1986). Unethical behavior, however, like other behaviors, is learned in social interaction. People learn the techniques of neutralization, which is a set of justifications or rationalizations that can insulate people from self-blame when they engage in norm-violating behaviors.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

The success of iTunes firmly supports this idea.\n\n*Companies should try to apply and realize the advantages of new technologies to increase consumers’ benefits, instead of resisting change, simply declaring their rights, and imposing the guilt of piracy on consumers. Consumers may be more willing to respect companies’ intellectual property rights if these companies care more about the welfare of their customers.\n|Description of Data=Scenario survey conducted with high school and university students face to face in class, with 674 returns and 451 valid responses.

Motivators and enablers of SCOURing: A study of online piracy in the US and UK. Journal of Business Research, 63(9), 1095-1102.\n|Abstract=Sharing Copyrighted or Unauthorized Replications (SCOURing) is a common activity among some 80 million online file-swappers. Unfortunately, SCOURing is also an illegal activity. A better understanding of SCOURing could help to mitigate its practice. To that end, results from an empirical study of US and UK consumers suggest SCOURing is explained by motivations (justification, believed pervasiveness by peers, believed risklessness, and experiential reasons) and ability (tech-savviness). If true, then companies\' efforts to reduce SCOURing by legal action or trying to educate consumers about the victims of SCOURing may be ineffective.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296309002033\n|Link=http://www.academia.edu/4452748/Motivators_and_enablers_of_SCOURing_A_study_of_online_piracy_in_the_US_and_UK\n|Reference=Huang (2005); Hennig-Thurau, Henning and Sattler (2007); Sinha and Mandel (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* Copy-protection schemes are as ineffective as legal sanctions. Network-and-software-savvy consumers eventually subvert barriers to SCOURing like encryption. Further, shuttering file-sharing networks merely shifted SCOURing to alternative networks.\n\n* Many consumers believe SCOURing is justified by past pricing abuses of impersonal corporations. Consumers are unwilling to pay more than a trivial amount to download music. Therefore, current pricing schemes for online access are unlikely to reduce SCOURing.\n\n* SCOURing is an entrenched consumer behavior. The most prolific—college-age consumers—grew up sharing files via accessibleP2P networks. As a result, they never or rarely paid for digitised intellectual property; for them, payment would be aberrant. \n\n* The decision to engage in SCOURing is based, at least partly, on beliefs about the behaviours of important others. Consistent with social learning theory, this research suggests peer influence relates positively to SCOURing.\n\n* Motivation (justification, peer influence, and believed risklessness) and ability (tech-savviness) as antecedents to SCOURing suggest why anti-SCOURing legal remedies were impotent and customer alienating. \n\n* If people act in a difficult-to-monitor way believed acceptable to other people, then efforts to coerce anyone to act otherwise is futile.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Strategic Management Journal, 24(4), 375-384.\n|Abstract=Building on the Resource-Based View of the firm, we advance the idea that a firm’s customer network can be a strategic asset. We suggest that network effects are a function of network size (i.e., installed customer base) and network strength (i.e., the marginal impact of a unit increase in network size on demand). We empirically study these network effects in the 16-bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting non-cooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega). Thus, our results provide a possible explanation for this situation in which the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) was able to overtake the sales of a firm with a larger network size (Sega).\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.296/abstract\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=296534\n|Reference=Garud and Kumaraswamy (1993); Hill (1995); Wade (1995); David and Greenstein (1990); Liebowitz and Margolis (1994);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Consistent with most theoretical models’ assumption that the direct effect of a customer network on demand is symmetric across competitors (e.g., Katz and Shapiro 1985; 1985; 1992; Farrell and Saloner 1985; 1986), This paper finds that:\n\n* The network size coefficients of Nintendo and Sega are significant but not statistically different. \n\n* In agreement with the hedonic price models for computer spreadsheet software (e.g., Gandal 1994; 1995; Brynjolfson and Kemerer 1996), Price effectiveness of Nintendo and Sega is a function of network size. \n\n* Each firm’s advertising effectiveness is influenced by its relative network size. \n\n* empirical results also show that Nintendo and Sega have asymmetric network effects since the interactive network strength values through price and advertising are statistically different for the two firms. \n\n* These asymmetric network strength values may help explain why Nintendo was able to pass Sega in monthly sales of 16-bit home video game systems despite Sega’s larger installed base.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Losses are measured in the tens of billions of dollars. college students especially are problematic, downloading more than 1 billion illegal songs per year. This paper reports on a four-phase research project. Phases I and II mapped specific motivations for the behavior and attendant reinforcements and costs. Phase III tested a variety of advertising concept statements intended to reverse the behavior. Phase Iv was an in-market survey of advertising campaigns across two college campuses. Two campaigns were significantly effective in reversing music piracy among college students.\n|Authentic Link=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=8bf3f446-6ffe-4585-a61e-0ee5db964666%40sessionmgr4001&hid=4101&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=buh&AN=79987280\n|Reference=Chiou, Huang and Lee (2005); Ingram and Hinduja (2008); Hennig-Thurau, Henning and Sattler (2007); Pfanner (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results reported in this study:\n\n*Research at both universities confirmed a strong correlation between past behavior and anticipated/perceived future behavior.\nAs a whole, the group that had downloaded music frequently each month would anticipate to continue, in general, to do so despite the advertising campaign messages. \n\nDespite this finding, nonetheless, the two campaigns did show signs of effectiveness:\n\n*Campaign 1 - “Viruses” - showed a somewhat significant correlation between perceptually decreased use of illegal programs and those who found the advertising convincing (this represented 12.8 percent of the sample population). \n\n*Campaign 1 was also found to have a somewhat significant correlation between decreased use of illegal programs and those who found the advertising persuasive (this represented 13.5 percent of respondents based on top three box scores).\n\n*Campaign 1 can be judged to be somewhat successful in changing the anticipated behavior of 12.8 percent of the college population. \n\n*Campaign 2 - “Getting a Good Job” - showed a highly significant correlation between both the perceptually increased use of legal programs and the perceptually decreased use of illegal programs and those who found the advertising convincing (this represented 19.1 percent of the population for increased use of legal programs and 15.3 percent of the sample population for decreased use of illegal programs). \n\n*Campaign 2 was also found to have a significant correlation between both the increased use of legal programs and the decreased use of illegal programs and those who found the advertising persuasive (this represented 12.1 percent of respondents based on top 3 box scores). \n\n*Campaign 2 can be judged to be highly successful in changing the anticipated downloading behavior of at least 15.3 percent to 19.1 percent of the college population. \n\n*Importantly, these numbers are not mutually exclusive; therefore, the total percentage of college students increasing their use of legal programs and/or decreasing their use of illegal programs is higher than 19.1 percent (perhaps significantly so), although the research team was not able to measure it exactly.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The research was conducted at a large eastern university. Sixteen students participated in four small focus groups; 15 individuals participated in in-depth interviews.Twenty-two participants were undergraduates, and nine were graduate students. They ranged in age from 18 to 27. The majority of subjects were Caucasian; there were two Hispanics, one Asian-American, and one African American.\n\n*The second phase was a quantitative phase, completed in June 2009 (Sheehan, Tsao, and Yang, 2010). A convenience sample of 204 college students from a large eastern university participated in an anonymous survey. Respondents were recruited from four undergraduate classes and one graduate class. The questionnaire included 59 questions related to the authors’ previous qualitative study of this subject.\n\n*The third phase, completed in March 2010, was an experimental phase entailing advertising-concept testing. Phase III included 415 participants from two universities; 48 percent of the sample came from a large eastern university, and 52 percent came from a mid-sized mid-western university. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents were male and 71 percent female.\nParticipants were randomly divided into 10 groups: eight experimental groups - each evaluating a separate concept - one generic group, and one control group.\n\n*The fourth phase, completed in December 2010, was an experimental stage. Two advertising campaigns were developed: the first campaign focused on the potential cost of ruining your computer based on catching a virus and ran at a mid-sized midwestern university, and the second focused on the risk that illegal downloading could affect your ability to get a job once you graduate from school, and ran at a large eastern university. The campaigns ran at significant weight levels on both campuses. After the last advertisements ran in student media, students on each campus were randomly sampled using a short question-naire. Campaign 1 was tested against 151 participants: 43 percent of the respondents were male, 57 percent female. Campaign 2 was tested against 462 participants: 32 percent of the respondents were male, 68 percent female.\n|Data Year=January 2009, June 2009, March 2010 and December 2010.\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Data Source=None;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Experimental (Field), Qualitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences), Semi-Structured Interview, Focus Groups\n|Method of Analysis=Regression Analysis\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=United States;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=Not Stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=16\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=January 2009\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=15\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=January 2009\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=204\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=June 2009\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=415\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=March 2010\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=151\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=December 2010\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=462\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=December 2010\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1318, 'title': 'Sheehan, Tsao and Yang (2010)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=204\n|Level of Aggregation=University students,\n|Data Material Year=February 2009\n}}\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Sheehan, Tsao and Yang (2010)\n|Author=Sheehan, B.;Tsao, J.;Yang, S.\n|Title=Motivations for gratifications of digital music piracy among college students\n|Year=2010\n|Full Citation=Sheehan, B., Tsao, J., & Yang, S.

Higher levels of social acceptance led to stronger motivations to illegally download.\n\n*A previously researched result was reinforced: when moral conscience was low, desire to illegally download is high (Gopal et al., 2004). Rather than being an absolute measure of moral conscience (i.e., right vs. wrong), if we look at this through the social lens, we can see it more as a measure of what is deemed socially acceptable or unacceptable. \n\n*In personal and group interviews, the legal cost for downloading using on-campus servers was seen as extremely high. Most respondents had a friend, or had heard of someone, who had been caught and/or fined. Off campus, in the “real world,” however, respondents indicated that their fear of being caught was infinitesimally small. \n\n*With such a low perceived possibility of being caught, it is reasonable to theorize that the optimistic bias of college kids regarding legal costs grew to such an extent that legal costs no longer had the potential to act as a brake on illegal behavior.\n|FundamentalIssue=5. Understanding consumption/use (e.g. determinants of unlawful behaviour; user-generated content; social media),\n|EvidenceBasedPolicy=F. Enforcement (quantifying infringement; criminal sanctions; intermediary liability; graduated response; litigation and court data; commercial/non-commercial distinction; education and awareness),\n|Discipline=K42: Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law\n|Intervention-Response=Policy Implications reported in the study:\n\n*The music industry should not only be developing strategies to fight individual downloaders, as a focus on individual lawsuits does. Rather, they should perceive the problem as fundamentally group oriented, or social. This indicates that grass roots efforts within colleges that focus on times when students are assembled either physically or in social networks could prove effective. \n\n*In terms of broader communication, messages with the objective of overturning peer group social acceptance by showing the cost of the behavior on the peer group, its image, or society at large might be more effective than focus on individual risks. \n\n*In addition to social strategies, any program, legal approach, or advertising campaign aiming to increase the perception of personal risk needs to reframe the perception of risk substantially. Aside from using on-campus servers, the perception of personal risk to college students is, today, very small. \n\n*A swift and drastic shift in perception would be important not just on an individual basis but because it could create a social tipping point among college peers. A key to combining personal and social costs might be to focus on things related to music piracy that could cause extreme personal embarrassment within the insular social peer networks of college campuses.\n|Description of Data=The convenience samples of the study included 204 college students who voluntarily participated in an anonymous survey in February 2009.

(2007). The analog hole and the price of music: An empirical study. Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law, 5, 573-587.\n|Abstract=We present the results of a series of surveys of college-aged consumers of music exploring their willingness to pay for digital downloads of music and measuring the impact of the so-called analog hole. The analog hole refers to a perhaps - unavoidable vulnerability of most digital rights management systems. In short, because people cannot consume digital information directly, every device that performs digital content must convert the digital information into an analog signal, which is very difficult to keep from being copied.\nAlthough the analog hole has been widely decried by content providers, surprisingly little is known about fundamental aspects of how it operates. Can average users exploit the analog hole, or is this limited to sophisticated users? Does analog hole copying significantly degrade the quality of music or video? Will people pay for music that isn\'t a perfect digital copy? Intuitions and guesses abound, but nobody has ever conducted a study to answer these questions. We have. Although our surveys\' sample sizes were too small to come to statistically significant conclusions, we did discover several interesting results including one tantalizingly specific result: What\'s the analog hole worth? Based on our survey, twenty-four cents. That\'s how much less our respondents were willing to pay for a music track when a perfect digital copy was replaced by an analog hole copy. Although our results need to be replicated on a larger scale, they suggest many conclusions that have never before been proved: people are willing to pay for less-than-perfect analog hole copies of songs; people will pay much more than half the price of a typically-priced digital music file for its degraded alternative; and even self-avowed "pirates" show a willingness to pay for digital music, albeit at prices well below today\'s market standard of ninety-nine cents a song.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V5I3/JTHTLv5i3_SickerOhmGunaji.PDF\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=969998\n|Reference=Yen (2003); Owens and Akalu (2004); Lin et al.

These results all point to lost opportunities for the music industry.\n\n* Price discrimination based on quality can increase sales, profits and seller surplus. The community of pirates may be “brought back into the fold” if the 80% who are willing to pay can find a market.\n\n* Furthermore, although analog hole exploits tend to lead to detectably degraded copies, many ordinary consumers will not notice the difference. This also supports industry fears that analog hole copies may serve as a market substitute for DRM-protected digital copies.\n\n* The survey sample sizes used in this study were not large enough to reach external validity for applying these results to the general population. Looking forward, a next step would be to execute a similar survey to the one administered for this paper but on a much larger scale.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

(2010). Don't think twice, it's all right: Music piracy and pricing in a DRM-free environment. Journal of Marketing, 74(2), 40-54.\n|Abstract=The music industry has widely viewed digital rights management (DRM) as an effective strategy for reducing digital piracy. Digital rights management systems aim to prevent unauthorized copying and to reduce the overall rate of piracy. Therefore, the recent move toward offering DRM-free music by some major online music sellers appears paradoxical. In this article, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes and estimates the concept of hardcore piracy in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Based on two large empirical studies and a validation exercise with a large sample of more 2000 college students, the model results indicate that the music industry can benefit from removing DRM because such a strategy has the potential to convert some pirates into paying consumers. In addition, a DRM-free environment enhances both consumer and producer welfare by increasing the demand for legitimate products as well as consumers’ willingness to pay for these products. The authors find that producers could benefit by lowering prices from currently observed levels. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the findings for managers within the music industry.\n|Authentic Link=http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.74.2.40\n|Reference=Peitz and Waelbroeck (2006); Salganik, Dodds and Watts (2006); Oberholzer and Strumpf (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Two related studies consider piracy from a demand perspective. A new model introduces the concept of “hardcore pirates”, offering a new and unique method for conceptualizing and measuring piracy in terms of willingness to pay (WTP).\n\n* The results indicate that Digital Rights Management (DRM) is not a control mechanism that is independent of consumer preferences but rather an important product attribute that consumers include in their evaluation of online music products. \n\n* The removal of DRM increases the utility of legally purchased music – for example, it can be played on different devices. This might increase consumers’ WTP for legally sold digital music.\n\n* Both studies therefore conclude that reducing DRM controls might  increase overall revenues for digital music, while converting some hardcore pirates into paying consumers.\n\n* Reductions in prices for music that is popular among college students might also be beneficial for both consumers and producers, though increased legal sales digital music.\n\n* Although the study was limited to college students, external evidence indicates that a significant proportion of software pirates are in that population.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Yet, there is no such thing as a television format right under copyright law. Any producer is free to develop game, reality and talent shows that are based on similar ideas.\nThis case study documents the exploitation of one such format, Idols, based on semi-structured interviews with format sellers and buyers at international media trade fairs, and senior managers at Fremantlemedia, the television production company that developed Idols into one of most successful global format franchises (broadcast in 43 territories).\n|Authentic Link=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/19520/1/Singh_Kretschmer_Idols_Published.pdf\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1465733\n|Reference=McInerney and Rose (1999); Kapferer (2000); Havens (2003); Elber (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The results reveal a combination of legal and non-legal strategies that in effect create an intellectual property (IP) regime that stands in place of formal television format rights (“IP without IP”). Empirically, format developers use three groups of strategies to exploit TV formats internationally: \n\n* TV format producers formalize and sell know-how which cannot be easily gleaned from watching the show. This knowledge may include how to source contestants and organise audience participation, as well as specific production elements. The format is codified in a so-called ‘production bible’, supplied under confidentiality agreements and licences, and supervised in implementation by ‘flying producers’. \n\n* Careful management of the brand image makes it difficult to copy a show successfully. Sub-strategies include the registration of relevant trade marks, localisation of the brand, and extending the brand by merchandising. \n\n* Having an established distribution networks and international production bases allow for speed to market, and retaliatory measures against copycat producers. Retaliation includes the bilateral threat of non-supply of other programmes, and negative reputation effects in the social network constructed around trade fairs.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

Preventing digital music piracy: the carrot or the stick?. Journal of Marketing, 72(1), 1-15.\n|Abstract=The goal of this article is to ascertain the factors that govern consumers’ willingness to pirate a digital product, such as a digital music track. The authors assess the tendency to pirate with both indirect measures (e.g., willingness to pay for the legal alternative) and direct measures (e.g., piracy preference). Whether measured indirectly or directly, the tendency to pirate depends, to different extents, on three key factors: positive incentives (e.g., improved functionality of the legal Web site), negative incentives (e.g., perceived risk of piracy), and consumer characteristics. Based on three studies, the results suggest that negative incentives are a strong deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy tendencies for others. Conversely, positive incentives, such as improved functionality, can significantly reduce the tendency to pirate among all the consumer segments studied. The authors conclude by discussing prescriptive recommendations for the recording industry.\n|Authentic Link=http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.1.1\n|Reference=Bhatia, Gay, and Honey (2003); Fry (2005); Smith (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of this study are:\n\n* RIAA’s efforts to use fear and shame to stop digital piracy may be effective only for certain segments of consumers. \n\n* Negative incentives are a strong deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy tendencies for others.\n\n* For consumers with high levels of optimum stimulation (and, thus, higher tolerance for risk), increasing the perceived risk might actually backfire by slightly increasing their likelihood to pirate.\n\n* Companies can decrease piracy behaviour by offering their music on legal, pay Web sites that offer enhanced features, such as a user-friendly environment, live concerts, and downloadable ringtones. \n\n*When these upgraded features are present, potential pirates do not allow other variables, such as risk and exploratory behaviour, to influence their piracy decision.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Our analysis, based on results from thousands of adults around the globe, shows that not only have remixes, mashups and other forms of "configurable culture" become mainstream phenomena, but also that the attitudes surrounding their cultural legitimacy are shifting. While copyright industries still promote a binary theft/permission framework, many people acknowledge the validity of some appropriation, and are actively negotiating the law’s limitations. Yet, those most engaged in challenging dominant copyright narratives and exploring these emergent forms are those who hold the reins of cultural power: the young, educated and wealthy.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291083-6101\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2344277\n|Reference=Aufderheide and Jaszi (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results of study:\n\n*Configurable cultural practices, which employ digital networked technologies and collapse the traditional distinction between production and consumption, have grown in awareness, usage and engagement among Americans in recent years. \n\n*Configurable culture has global reach and its impact is greater outside of the US than within it.\n\n*The authors found that nationality, age, gender and income tend to vary with degrees of expertise, awareness, usage, engagement and opinion regarding these cultural practices.\n\n*Young people are far more likely than their elders to concede that appropriation-based work such as mashups and remixes are always or sometimes “original” and therefore culturally valuable or valid. \n\n*Users of Creative Commons licenses tend to skew younger, wealthier, better educated, and more male than the overall population, problematizing the premise that such licenses may serve to democratize cultural power.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Nature and Scope of exclusive rights (hyperlinking/browsing; reproduction right),\n|Discipline=K: Law and Economics, O34: Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital\n|Intervention-Response=Policy Implications:\n\n*Findings on configurability, gender and income raise some concerns regarding self-efficacy and social equality. \n\n*While men and women appear to know about configurable culture in equal numbers, the enduring gap in engagement, especially when it comes to technology-centric media such as software and games, suggests that even if they have an equivalent level of access to digital technology, women tend to have a lower level of expertise and/or perceived self-efficacy in relation to such technology. \n\n*Similarly, the fact that income tends to vary with usage and engagement, but not awareness, suggests that full participation in digital culture still requires a degree of social power conferred by wealth. This provides further support for critiques of “digital divide” research that complicate the traditional measures of access and exposure to new technologies by suggesting that expertise and self-efficacy are vital elements of social equality as well.\n|Description of Data=In July 2006, the authors fielded a survey (completed by 1,779 respondents) dedicated to exploring the awareness, behaviors and opinions of US adults regarding configurable cultural practices across a range of media, including mashups, remixes (music and video), machinima (fan movies made with video games), and mods (fan-created video game modifications).\n\nAs in the 2006 study, 2010 survey respondents were members of a larger panel previously recruited online by a California-based market research firm called Intellisurvey.

They are confident about their understanding of it—in fact, more confident than they should be, because they believe they know more than they demonstrate that they do. \n\n* The communication scholars' lack of expertise as to fair use is hurting them, because too often they are not comfortable in asserting their rights or are not able to engage gatekeepers such as librarians, general counsels, editors, publishers, and funders whose policies do not accommodate existing law. Thus, they decide not to undertake some types of projects (although they can imagine undertaking them absent copyright concerns) and change other projects to accord with their insecurities or concerns.\n\n* Positive changes have occurred in communication scholars’ behaviors since publication of the code of best practices. The data resulting from the survey show increased use of open licenses and open access options, especially among newer faculty. However, there is no improvement in the level of frustration communication scholars experience within their institutional relationships. Thus, some positive changes have occurred, but they lack the ecological effects that are intended to result from a consensus document such as the code of best practices.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Unfortunately, disentangling these two effects is extremely difficult.\nIn this paper we attempt to disentangle these two effects by applying fixed effects and first difference models to a new dataset quantifying changes in broadband Internet penetration and DVD sales at a local level from 2000 to 2003. We then compare our results to those reported in Liebowitz (2008), who uses similar models in a similar time period on a similar product category: music CDs.\nUnlike Liebowitz, who finds a strong negative impact of broadband penetration on music sales, our results show that increased broadband penetration leads to a significant increase in DVD sales. Using the most conservative results, 9.3% of the $14.1 billion increase in DVD sales during our study period can be attributed to increased broadband penetration. One interpretation of these results is that the difference arises from differences in the ability\nto pirate these two types of content: while Internet music piracy was easy and rampant from 2000 to 2003, Internet movie piracy was difficult and of generally low quality in this time period. If this interpretation is true it would suggest that, in the absence of piracy, the Internet has an overall strong positive impact on media sales.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624510000259\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=918240\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2008),; Hui and Png, 2003; Zentner, 2006; Rob and Waldfogel (2007); Danaher et al.

(2012). New insights into the problem of software piracy: The effects of neutralization, shame, and moral beliefs. Information & Management, 49(7), 334-341.\n|Abstract=Software piracy is a major economic concern for organizations. Previous research indicates that neutralization, a form of rationalization, can help explain software piracy intentions. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of which neutralization techniques most influence software piracy intention. To address this gap, we developed a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intention. We included different types of deterrents (formal sanctions, shame, and moral belief) in our model because individuals may use neutralization techniques to mitigate feelings of guilt and shame, which, subsequently, reduce the deterrent effect. Our empirical results (for 183 people surveyed) showed that appeal to higher loyalties and condemn the condemners strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, informal deterrents such as shame and moral beliefs are strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational intervention aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques rather than relying on formal sanctions.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0378720612000493\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/257222778_New_insights_into_the_problem_of_software_piracy_The_effects_of_neutralization_shame_and_moral_beliefs\n|Reference=Higgins, Wilson and Fell (2005); Morris and Higgins (2009); Peace, Galletta and Thong L.

This finding is consistent with studies on corporate crime, it differs from that of Higgins et al (2005).\n\n*Although these findings suggest that 'Formal Sanctions' may not be a strong predictor of intent to pirate software, there may be other forms of sanctions that can deter software piracy. For example, the effect of 'Shame' on intention to commit piracy was significant.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This twelfth report presents estimates of the copyright industries’ contribution to the U.S. economy for the years 2003-2007, which reflects the most recent full-year data (2007) available at the time of the publication. This report demonstrates the continuing positive impact these industries have on the U.S. economy.\n\nThis study continues to reflect the use of industry data classifications adopted under the North American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) which has now been widely implemented by U.S. statistical agencies. This report also continues to follow the international standards and recommendations propounded by the World Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO”) in 2003 regarding the development of economic and statistical standards to measure the impact of domestic copyright industries on domestic economies.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.iipa.com/pdf/IIPASiwekReport2003-07.pdf\n|Reference=Siwek (2007); Siwek (2004); Siwek (2002); Siwek (2002);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- From 2003 to 2007:\n* The GDP rose from $11.0T to $13.8T, with the value-added from copyright industries amounting to $889.1B in 2003 and rising to $1.52T by 2007.\n* The core copyright industries achieved annual growth rates in excess of 5.8% per year. These growth rates were considerably above the real annual growth rates achieved by the U.S. economy as a whole.\n* In 2003, the total copyright industries employed 11,205,700 people, and these workers comprised 8.62% of total U.S. employment. By 2007, total copyright industry employment rose by 504,900 to 11,710,600 workers. In 2007, workers in the total copyright industries comprised 8.51% of all U.S. employees, down slightly from 8.62% in 2003.\n* The average annual compensation paid to a core copyright industry employee in 2003 was $63,496. In 2007, the average compensation paid to a core copyright worker rose to $73,554 or 15.8%.\n* The revised and updated estimates of foreign sales and exports of selected core copyright industries portray continued growth on the whole with a somewhat mixed picture among the individual industries studied.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

As in past studies, the U.S. copyright industries’ contribution to the U.S. economy is measured by three economic indicators: value-added to the U.S. current dollar gross domestic product (“GDP”); share of national employment; and revenues generated from foreign sales and exports. In addition, this study includes two additional indicators of the importance of the copyright industries to the U.S. economy: compensation per employee and the contribution of the copyright industries to the real annual growth of the U.S. economy.\n|Data Year=2003-2007\n|Data Type=Secondary data\n|Data Source=U.S. Census Bureau; U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Quantitative data/text mining, Longitudinal Study, Qualitative Collection Methods, Ethnography\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Cluster analysis, Correlation and Association, Multivariate Statistics, Qualitative Analysis Methods, Qualitative Coding / Sorting (e.g. of interview data)\n|Industry=Creative, arts and entertainment; Film and motion pictures; Sound recording and music publishing; Computer programming; Software publishing (including video games);\n|Country=United States;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=International Intellectual Property Alliance;\n}}\n|Dataset=\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

J. (2006). Vermeers and Rembrandts in the same attic: Complementarity between copyright and trademark leveraging strategies in software. Georgia Institute of Technology TIGER Working Paper.\n|Abstract=We examine the interrelationships between firms’ efforts to leverage different types of intellectual property (IP) rights.  While prior research has tended to view different forms of intellectual property as substitutes, we argue that they can also be viewed as complements.  We motivate this argument by shifting the unit of analysis away from the level of a single invention to the level of the technology, product or firm.  Using unstructured interviews, we develop hypotheses about the causes of IP\ncomplementarity. Specifically, we hypothesize that complementarity may result from common inputs into the management of IP within the firm, such as managerial attention to IP issues and organizational resources deployed for IP management.  Our hypotheses are tested in the PC software industry with a seemingly-unrelated-regression (SUR) model, which provides support for complementarity between copyrights and trademarks in software, and suggests that this complementarity stems at least in part from \nour hypothesized common inputs into IP management.  Our work addresses both the relative neglect of non-patent intellectual property rights and the disproportionate reliance on the IP-as-substitutes view in prior research.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=887484\n|Reference=Samuelson (1994); Arora (1995); Cohen, Nelson and Wash (2000); Harabi (1995);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results:\n\n*The authors propose a broader view of the interactions between different types of IP, where both substitution and complementarity is possible. They abstract away from individual inventions to look at the set of multiple inventions contained in a product or a firm.\n\n*When the analysis is focused on a set of inventions, opportunities for IP complementarity arise because firms may extract value by leveraging one type of IP for some inventions while at the same time leveraging another type of IP for other related inventions. Such complementarity may occur due to either production-cost or market-driven interactions, which increase the value of using different types of IP together.\n\n*The research uncovers robust evidence that the use of two types of intellectual property – copyright and trademark – is strongly correlated in software firms. \n\n*The interview evidence also supports the idea that these forms of intellectual property may be leveraged in a complementary fashion. From a managerial perspective, this finding suggests that firms may benefit by paying attention to the complementary configuration of different types of IP to protect their bundles of intellectual assets, rather than focusing on each one in isolation. \n\n*Both the interview evidence and empirical results corroborate the use of common indivisible inputs in IP strategies, expressly managerial attention and organizational resources, as an important explanation for our finding of IP complementarity.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Another potential direction for research would be to abstract away from the single invention unit of analysis along the temporal dimension, and study the interactions between different types of IP for a related set of inventions over time. \n\n*The results do not specifically explain why some firms paid greater attention to IP strategy and developed superior organizational IP resources over certain time frames. Future research can help us understand when firms react to changes in their intellectual property environments with responsive strategies, and when they do not.\n|Description of Data=Primary Data: The authors contacted 25 executives identified as IP legal counsel or IP managers in 19 of the top 100 U.S. packaged software firms by revenue (2001). 6 individuals (38%) at 5 firms agreed to be interviewed. These firms each had greater than $50 million annual revenues and 500 employees in 2001. Using open-ended unstructured interviews we asked each respondent whether software firms were likely to use different types of IP together in a complementary manner. \n\nSecondary Data: The authors focused on the (IBM) PC packaged software industry, and included all top-100 firms in this segment from 1985 to 1999 (by revenue, obtained from a commercial firm, Softletter). They identified all copyright, patent, and trademark litigation involving the firms in the sample by matching on firm names, using IP litigation data from the Federal Judicial Center (FJC). Mergers and acquisitions among firms were also tracked to ensure that ongoing litigation was assigned to the correct successor firms. In addition to IP litigation data, the authors collected copyright count data from the Library of Congress, patent applications, trademark filings, and a count of registered patent attorneys employed by each firm from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), along with public accounting data for the firms from Research Insight. The Softletter-100 lists also provide data on founding years, annual revenues and employment for each firm, which supplement the Research Insight data.

J., & Burns, Z. C. (2012). What's a Name Worth?: Experimental Tests of the Value of Attribution in Intellectual Property. Boston University Law Review, 93, 1.\n|Abstract=Despite considerable research suggesting that creators value attribution – that is, being named as the creator of a work – U.S. intellectual property (IP) law does not provide a right to attribution to the vast majority of creators. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are much more complicated.\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to measure quantitatively the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a “creativity effect” that results in their assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced: creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be restructured to provide attribution as a creator’s default right.\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default, they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, paradoxically, our findings suggest that we should exercise caution before we restructure U.S. law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators. Indeed, it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting.\nFinally, our findings have implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.\n|Authentic Link=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/fac_schol/733/\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2011403\n|Reference=Buccafusco and Springman (2010); Buccafusco and Sprigman (2011); Coase (1960); Landes and Posner (2003); Fisk (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main results:\n\n*The photographers behaved similarly to the poets and painters in the authors' previous experiments, and set their WTA significantly higher than their expected mean value.\n\n*For amateur photographers, the prospect of publication with attribution results in a significantly lower 'Willingness To Accept' (WTA) compared to the WTA reported by subjects in the Contest and Publication conditions pooled together. This finding suggests that the prospect of publication with attribution has a modest but nonetheless statistically significant effect of reducing WTA compared to a situation where subjects are not offered the prospect of publication with attribution.\n\n*Given the strong preference for attribution, publication without attribution may be viewed negatively, which would account for the higher average WTA in the Publication condition versus the Contest condition (although this was not significant at the 0.05 confidence level).\n\n*The data also suggest that professional and advanced amateur photographers place a somewhat greater value on the prospect of publication with attribution compared with their amateur counterparts. The professional subjects’ WTA in the Attribution condition was lower by a significant amount compared to the Contest subjects’ WTA. This is fairly strong evidence that creators attach some substantial value to credited publication of their work.\n\n*The creators’ behavior indicates that they valued attribution at $415.07. The professional and advanced amateur photographers value attribution far more than the casual snapshooters.\n\n*In the third experiment, subjects altered the amount of money they were willing to accept in ways that were consistent with placing a significant economic value on attribution.\n\n*This study suggests that a waivable default attribution rule could have a significant – and negative – effect on the efficiency of markets to license IP.\n\n*When the subjects were initially endowed with a right to attribution, they valued it substantially more than they did when they were not so endowed and had to purchase it. In the study, subjects valued attribution four times higher under the Default Attribution condition than when the default was no attribution.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

The experiments provide new data that can help shape the debate about the desirability of attribution rights in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n*These experiments indicate that, all else being equal, altering U.S. copyright law to provide creators with default attribution rights can result in higher transaction costs and less efficient transacting.\n\n*U.S. copyright law, which provides creators of a wide variety of artistic and literary works with broad rights to control reproduction, distribution, modification, and the public performance and display of their works, does not provide most creators with any general right to attribution. This research provides quantitative empirical evidence for the notion that creators significantly value attribution.\n\n*It does not necessarily follow that the U.S. should include a right to attribution in the law simply because creators value it. From a utilitarian perspective, attribution, just like any other aspect of IP rights, should be assigned in such a way that it is likely to reduce transaction costs and generate efficient bargains. \n\n*In light of the findings of the third experiment, the research seems to undermine utilitarian arguments for creating a waivable attribution right.\n|Description of Data=The authors performed three separate experiments. \n\nExperiment 1: This experiment tested the value that creators attach to attribution and publication. 200 “lay” creative subjects, who indicated an interest in photography, were recruited as participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: contest, publication or attribution, yielding 198 usable results. \n\nExperiment 2: This experiment tested the value that creators attach to attribution and publication, but using professional and serious amateur creators. 88 participants were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: contest, publication or attribution, yielding 77 usable results.\n\nExperiment 3: This experiment explored the economic effects of creating a waivable default attribution right. Participants were recruited using mTurk, by advertising for subjects who were aspiring photographers interested in having their work entered into a contest. They were offered $2 for participating. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Default Attribution and No Default Attribution.

But empirical evidence gives much reason to doubt these assumptions; people exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and bounded willpower. This article offers a broad vision of how law and economics analysis may be improved by increased attention to insights about actual human behavior. It considers specific topics in the economic analysis of law and proposes new models and approaches for addressing these topics. The analysis of the article is organized into three categories: positive, prescriptive, and normative. Positive analysis of law concerns how agents behave in response to legal rules and how legal rules are shaped. Prescriptive analysis concerns what rules should be adopted to advance specified ends. Normative analysis attempts to assess more broadly the ends of the legal system: Should the system always respect people's choices? By drawing attention to cognitive and motivational problems of both citizens and government, behavioral law and economics offers answers distinct from those offered by the standard analysis.\n|Authentic Link=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=law_and_economics\n|Link=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=law_and_economics\n|Reference=Posner (1998); Eisenberg (1995); Ellickson (1989); Arrow (1987); Edwards and von Winterfeldt (1986);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Traditional law and economics is largely based on the standard assumptions of neoclassical economics. These assumptions are sometimes useful but often false. People display bounded rationality: they suffer from certain biases, such as overoptimism and self-serving conceptions of fairness; they follow heuristics, such as availability, that lead to mistakes; and they behave in accordance with prospect theory rather than expected utility theory. People also have bounded willpower; they can be tempted and are sometimes myopic. They take steps to overcome this limitations. Finally, people are boundedly self-interested.\n\n* Even in a world without transactions costs and wealth effects, the assignment of property rights alters the allocation of resources, and that this may be particularly true for certain forms of property-rights assignment (such as court orders). These features of the world matter greatly for making predictions and formulating policy\n\n* People react differently to potential outcomes depending on whether they are perceived as foregone gains or out-of-pocket costs (losses), and that they are likely to think, mistakenly, that salient events are more common than equally prevalent but more subtle ones. These points bear on the supply of and the demand for law, and on the behavior of agents in their interactions with the legal system\n\n* Many laws which are seemingly inefficient and do not benefit powerful interest groups may be explained on grounds of judgments about right and wrong.\n\n* Cognitive difficulties and motivational distortions undermine or alter conventional economic prescriptions about the jury's role, most notably in the context of assessing negligence and making other factual determinations\n\n* A behavioural approach raises serious doubts about the reflexive antipaternalism of some of economic analysis of law. On the other hand, it raises equivalent questions about whether even well-motivated public officials will be able to offer appropriate responses to private mistakes and confusion.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2012). Intellectual property law compliance in Europe: Illegal file sharing and the role of social norms. New media & society, 14(7), 1147-1163.\n|Abstract=The current study empirically demonstrates the widely discussed gap between copyright law and social norms. Theoretically founded in the sociology of law, the study uses a well-defined concept of norms to quantitatively measure changes in the strength of social norms before and after the implementation of legislation. The ‘IPRED law’ was implemented in Sweden on 1 April 2009, as a result of the EU IPR Enforcement Directive 2004/48/EC. It aims at enforcing copyright, as well as other IP rights, when they are violated, especially online. A survey was conducted three months before the IPRED law came into force, and it was repeated six months later. The approximately one thousand respondents between fifteen and twenty-five years-of-age showed, among other things, that although actual file-sharing behaviour had to some extent decreased in frequency, social norms remained unaffected by the law.\n|Authentic Link=http://nms.sagepub.com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/content/14/7/1147.full\n|Link=https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/2520386\n|Reference=Svensson and Larsson (2009); Goodenough and Decker (2008); Feldman and Nadler (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results reported by the study:\n\n*The results indicate that the implementation of enforcement strategies in Sweden has not triggered any sudden changes in the strength of social norms relating to illegal file sharing\n\n*However, the fact that IPRED actually changed people’s behaviour with regard to compliance contradicts that conclusion. Behavioural change sometimes leads to changes in the social norm structures, even when the former has occurred as a result of enforcement strategies.\n\n*The survey results show that one possible cause why people in common ignore copyright online is the lack of social norms that reinforce the legal framework. Generally, people observe informal social control, and when the law, as in this instance, lacks a social equivalent, there are only weak incentives for them to comply with it. \n\n*If implementation of IPRED in Swedish legislation on April 1 2009 was able to influence social norms, the effect was marginal; thus the pedagogical effect of the law does not come into play.\n\n*Considerably more respondents stated that they ￼never file-share in Study 2 than is the case in Study 1. This means that the implementation of IPRED actually has had an effect on file sharing as such, but this is a purely deterrent effect rather than a change of social norms. \n\nThe study reports the following limitations:\n\n*Limitations inherent in the quantitative approach suggest a need for future qualitative research that complements the understanding of file sharing and legal compliance from a situated-cognitive perspective. This could include the impact of other factors such as the media’s role in communicating legal revisions, or a more language and conceptual metaphor-based approach to copyright formulations and functions in comparison with a digitalized society \n\n*A follow up-study ￼of the same survey as in this study might prove useful in confirming, refuting or nuancing the long-time effects of IPRED’s implementation that are suggested here.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Given the generativity of the technologies of online communication in networks, these counter-measures may imply an increased diffusion of techniques of online anonymization. \n\n*This means that the legal enforcement of copyright not only risks undermining public confidence in the legal system in general, but also facilitates the diffusion of technological knowledge that will undermine legal enforcement in general when it comes to computer-mediated crime.\n|Description of Data=Two surveys were conducted: the first in January and February 2009, with 1047 internet users aged between fifteen and twenty-five years, and the second in October 2009 with a different set of 1047 internet users, again aged between fifteen and twenty-five years. IPRED was implemented on April 1st 2009. The selection was made randomly for the age group, from the CINT5 panel exchange register that contains details of 250,000 individuals in Sweden (a country with nine million inhabitants), and that represents a national average of the population. The fact that the respondents are on this register means that they have agreed in advance to participate in online self-administered questionnaires (SAQ), and receive a small fee for taking part in a survey. The fact that the surveys were SAQ is of great relevance in this context, as it has been shown that respondents are more likely ‘to report sensitive or illegal behaviour when they are allowed to use the SAQ format than during a personal interview over the telephone or in person’ (Wolf, 2008).\n|Data Year=January to February 2009 and October 2009.\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Data Source=None;\n|Method of Collection=Qualitative Collection Methods, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences)\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Correlation and Association\n|Country=Sweden;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=The Swedish Knowledge Foundation;\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1357, 'title': 'Svensson and Larsson (2009)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=1074\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=2009\n}}\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Svensson and Larsson (2009)\n|Author=Svensson, M.;Larsson, S.\n|Title=Social Norms and Intellectual Property\n|Year=2009\n|Full Citation=Svensson, M., & Larsson, S. (2009). Social Norms and Intellectual Property. Online norms and the European legal development.\n|Abstract=This report is the result of study that was performed in January and February 2009. It was presented and reviewed at the Annual Meeting of the Law and Society Association: Law, Power, and Inequality in the 21st Century in May 2009. The study empirically examined, or rather examined the lack of, social norms opposing illegal file sharing. A total of over 1,000 respondents have answered the questionnaire. Along with the social norm indicators, the study maps out relevant questions regarding internet behaviour in this field, such as the will to use anonymity services and the will to pay for copyrighted content. These results are compared and contrasted with the legal development trend in European law in internet and file sharing related matters, as well as the Swedish implementation of this development, as a member of the European Union. This includes the Intellectual Property Enforcement Directive (IPRED), the Directive on Data retention as well as the implementation of INFOSOC. Svensson and Larsson in Social Norms and Intellectual Property – Online norms and the European legal development consequently portrays the social norms on the one hand and the legal development on the other, and the overarching question of the report therefore addresses the correlation of these two. Do the social norms amongst 15-25 year olds match the legal regulation, as well as the regulatory trend on this field? If not, how can this be understood or explained? The study shows that the cybernorms differ, both in inherent structures and origin, from current legal constructions.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1598288\n|Reference=Hugenholtz (2000); Larsson (2005); Svensson (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=There are three main findings in this study:\n\n* Firstly, the results indicate no social norms that hinder illegal file sharing. The surrounding imposes no moral or normative obstruction for the respondents file sharing of copyrighted content.\n\n* Secondly, the legal trend does not correlate to this social norm in any way. On the contrary, there is a striking discrepancy between the social norms on illegal file sharing of copyrighted content and the legal regulation.\n\n* Thirdly, there are strong indications that neither the law in itself nor new legal attempts at enforcing copyright will change the social norm on illegal file sharing.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

(2004, December). Does file sharing reduce music CD sales?: A case of Japan version 0.1. In Conference on IT innovation.\n|Abstract=File sharing systems such as Napster and KaZaA are accused by the recording industry of causing declines in sales of music CDs, and recently users of these systems are under lawsuit attack. However, there is not sufficient evidence that file sharing systems are responsible for the recent decline in music CD sales. Two previous studies examined micro data of sales and downloads and found mixed results regarding the connection between file sharing and CD sales (Blackburn, 2004; Oberholzer and Strumpf, 2004).\n\nThe current essay estimated the effect of file sharing systems on music CD sales using micro data from Japan in 2004. Japan’s file sharing system (“Winny”) is almost completely decentralized and highly anonymous compared with ones addressed in the two previous studies, thus Japanese users can download music files with less concern about lawsuits. The goal of this research is to examine the effect of file sharing on music CD sales in such an illegal-copy-friendly file sharing system.\n\nBased on micro data of CD sales and numbers of downloads, we found that there was very little evidence that file sharing reduces music CD sales in Japan. We controlled simultaneous bias between sales and downloads by instrumental variables, but did not find correlation between CD sales and numbers of downloads. Although there were large differences in the numbers of downloads among CD titles, these differences did not affect CD sales. We also carried out a user survey on file sharing and CD purchases with consideration to the potential bias of respondents trying to understate their illegal copying activity. This survey also showed that file sharing had very limited influence on CD purchases.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubs.iir.hit-u.ac.jp/admin/en/pdfs/show/602\n|Reference=Takeyama (1994); Blackburn (2004); Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Japanese file sharing system: "Winny" allows users to download illegal music files anonymously and free of charge. This study examined the extent of any correlation between the use of Winny and legitimate music CD sales in Japan. The study also examined the existence of any correlation between the file sharing activity of Japanese students and their purchase of legitimate music CDs. Despite prevalent recording industry concern, it is concluded that the use of file sharing systems has no discernible negative effect on CD music sales and specifically:\n\n*  There is very little evidence to suggest that file sharing systems reduce sales of legitimate CDs in Japan;\n\n*  Student surveys did not show any negative relationship between respondent use of file sharing systems and propensity to make legitimate CD purchases;\n\n* Use of file sharing software by students may in fact increase their propensity to purchase legitimate music CDs.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The effect of interpersonal influence on softlifting intention and behaviour. Journal of Business Ethics, 56(2), 149-161.\n|Abstract=The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of interpersonal influence on personal software piracy, also known as softlifting. A laboratory experiment with 54 subjects was conducted, in which each subject was told to participate in a software quality evaluation exercise. However, a ploy was carried out to measure the subjects’ intention in software piracy under different levels of group pressure and financial gains. The results are interesting. On the intention of softlifting, both group pressure and financial gains are significant determinants. The interaction of group pressure and financial gains is also significant: when group pressure is toward pirating software, financial gains is not a relevant factor; whereas when group pressure is toward purchasing, financial gains becomes a dominant factor in softlifting intention. A further survey (with 216 college students from two public universities in Taiwan) designed to investigate the relationship between consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (Bearden et al., 1989) and softlifting intention/behavior. A path analysis demonstrated that normative influence was related to softlifting intention, yet information influence effect was marginal.

But the group pressure and price of software consistently influence people’s intention of copying respectively. \n\n- In study two:\n\n* The norms that a group forms determine an individual’s softlifting intention rather than the information that a group provides. This implies that interpersonal influence is related to softlifting intention, rather than softlifting behavior directly. \n\n* Normative influence is more powerful than informational influence in shaping peers’ intention and behavior.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

If prices are set at a level that is not perceived to be expensive, the effects of a positive social norm will be more effective.\n|Description of Data=In study one: Subjects were students of an introductory database course of the Management Information Systems department at the National Central University. Respondents were comprised of 43 males and 11 females, with an average age of 20. Subjects were volunteers recruited to participate in a disguised software quality evaluation exercise, earning NT$100 in cash within 15 minutes (approximately US$4). Each subject was randomly assigned to one of four experimental situations. \n\nIn study two: a questionnaire was designed to measure interpersonal influence, softlifting intention and behavior and it was administered to undergraduate students in two public universities in Taiwan. 206 useable questionnaires were collected to form the sample. 69% were male.

(September 2009). American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy & the Law, Vol. 18, forthcoming 2010; Arizona Legal Studies Discussion Paper No. 09-21.\n|Abstract=Over the past few decades, the filk community has expanded from a small group of science fiction convention-goers who occupied unused convention rooms during the late night hours to a community large enough to organize several dedicated filk conventions each year, a Hall of Fame, and an annual awards ceremony. While many filk songs are original lyrics set to original music, many more filk songs consist of lyrics written to existing music and/or lyrics based on characters/worlds created by other people. These practices potentially create problems in light of existing intellectual property law. In this paper, we explore those issues and whether a filker's gender influences his or her attitude towards intellectual property law. After setting out a basic explanation of filk and the intellectual property issues, the article details the various statistical results generated from the databases we built (one objective and one subjective) and draws some conclusions about gender and filk.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1393611\n|Plain Text Proposition=This Survey explores the intellectual property issues implicated by filk music (“Filk” is the term used to describe the music of the science fiction community, and “filkers” are the members of the filk community and are most commonly found participating in song circles at science fiction conventions) and, through two empirical databases, inquire whether a filker’s gender influences his or her attitude towards intellectual property law. More specifically, it shows that:\n\n* Although men and women initially published songs at roughly the same rate twenty years ago, men quickly began outpacing women in the rate of publication, and indeed, between the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, there was a sharp decline in the number of songs published by women.\n\n* Women in the filk community are more likely than men to create original melodies to accompany their lyrics, while women are only somewhat more likely to borrow from others’ lyrics than are men.\n\n* Female respondents were much more likely to define fair use as not profiting from others’ work, and somewhat more likely to define it as giving credit to the original author and making private as opposed to public use of a protected work\n\n* Male respondents were slightly less likely than female respondents to make use of the lyrics of others, i.e., slightly more likely to create their own original lyrics.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

It then analyzes those databases for relationships between gender and the other elements of the database. The first of these two databases, which contained 895 songs when completed, identified the author’s gender and whether the lyrics and/or the melody for each song used copyrighted material. The second database consists of the responses to a survey questionnaire administered to members of the filk community. The survey was admittedly not administered in a scientifically calculated method. This second database consists of 62 responses, which approximately constitutes somewhere between 5% and 10% of the active filk community.\n|Data Year=2009\n|Data Type=Primary and Secondary data\n|Data Source=Xenofilkia Magazine;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Case Study\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation)\n|Industry=Sound recording and music publishing; Cultural education; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=United States;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=None;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=895\n|Level of Aggregation=Songs,\n|Data Material Year=1988-2009\n}}{{Dataset\n|Sample Size=62\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=2009\n}}\n}}"}], 'ns': 0}]}

Journal of Services Marketing, 26(7), 472-483.\n|Abstract=Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess how well digital piracy self-report intentions predict actual digital piracy behaviors in service marketing research.\n\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Study 1 collects 321 surveys to investigate potential measurement issues related to digital piracy intention formation. Study 2 replicates Study 1 based on a separate sample of 267 respondents, and additionally links digital piracy intentions to directly observed digital piracy behaviors across a peer-to-peer network.\n\nFindings – The results first validate a strong predictive relationship between self-report intentions and observed digital piracy behaviors (R2 ¼ 0:36). Second, common method bias and measurement error do not appear to threaten the veracity of reported results. Third, a social psychological model of how digital piracy behaviors emerge is validated based upon the folk theory of the mind. Finally, a two-dimensional conceptualization of frequency of past behaviors is identified based upon exploratory factor analysis using structural equation modeling. \n\nResearch limitations/implications – The research reported here relies on experimental methods of measuring peer-to-peer network activity. Future research might consider the motivational and attitudinal antecedents to digital piracy intention formation.\n\nPractical implications – The results afford service marketers assurance that self-report measures of digital piracy behavioral intentions can serve as predictive measures of future behaviors. This helps make the collection of data in this context both achievable and practical. Also, a methodological framework is identified to strengthen measurement models associated with this type of research.\n\nOriginality/value – The research provides a first effort to empirically relate behavioral intention data to unobtrusively observed digital piracy behaviors across peer-to-peer networks.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/08876041211266404\n|Reference=Taylor (2007); Taylor, Ishida and Wallace (2009); Williams, Hartman and Cavazotte (2010); Sweeney (2010);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article aims at a twofold analysis of primary data in order to assess how well digital piracy self-report intentions predict actual digital piracy behaviors in service marketing research. The analysis shows that: \n\n*There is a strong predictive relationship between digital piracy intention formation and subsequent behaviors. \n\n*The relative contributions of the desire to engage in digital piracy behaviors and ‘frequency’ reported by Taylor et al. (2009) are validated in two independent samples.\n\n*Evidence of substantial undetected digital piracy was identified in this study suggesting that much of the activity occurs outside of internet-based peer-to-peer networks.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Intention to engage in digital piracy a conceptual model and empirical test. Journal of Service Research, 11(3), 246-262.\n|Abstract=Digital piracy represents a significant threat to the marketers of digital service products. Industry efforts to attenuate the practice, often deterrent in nature, have largely failed. We propose that one reason for this failure is the absence of a commensurably accepted model of the social psychological foundations underlying digital piracy behaviors. A modified version of Perugini and Bagozzi's (2001) Model of Goal Directed Behavior is advocated and empirically validated across both movie and music industry settings for this purpose. The results support the theoretical and empirical efficacy of the proposed model and highlight the importance of attitudes toward the act of digital piracy, the frequency of past digital piracy behaviors, and the motivations and intentions underlying digital piracy. A normative framework is proposed with five actionable recommendations to assist digital service marketers in better addressing digital piracy. The research implications of the reported study are also presented and discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/11/3/246.short\n|Link=http://beta.orionsshoulders.com/Resources/articles/26_22334_%20().pdf\n|Reference=Gopal et al.

The authors argue that one reason for this is the lack of a clear understanding of the social psychological underpinnings of DP behaviors.\n\n- A firm understanding of the social psychological model underlying DP appears to be a prerequisite for the development of efficacious marketing communication strategies designed to persuade individuals to attenuate their DP activities.\n\n- This study provide a roadmap to guide service marketers in meeting this challenge by focusing on marketing persuasion strategies that specifically affect the motivations, the attitudes underlying such motivations, and the Frequency of Past Behavior in engaging in DP.\n\n- Overall, the results support further consideration of attitudinal explanations of goal-directed behaviors and suggest that a great deal is yet to be learned in terms of developing effective methods of persuading individuals to not engage in DP.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Second, the current focus on deterrent strategies appears relatively ineffective and in fact may be strengthening the will to engage in DP. So, consistent with the first recommendation, it appears judicious to begin trying to identify successful means of persuading stakeholders to not engage in DP. Third, it is important to recognize the need to simultaneously target elementary and middleschool students as part of the overall communication strategy. Fourth, some effort has to be undertaken to begin the process of managing the overall images of the involved industries as well. Finally, the authors call on service marketing practitioners involved with the exchange of digital service products to actively pursue stronger relationships between their industry representatives and academic institutions to assist in the development of effective integrated marketing communication plans and marketing research agendas.\n|Description of Data=Data were collected through an online survey.

Poetics, 37(3), 227-249.\n|Abstract=This paper looks at the largely unexplored terrain of how young people find music that is new to them in an environment with an unprecedented number of possibilities. Digital media has changed not only how artists create and distribute content, but also how listeners find and access new material. The new options exist in the context of older traditions such as using one’s social networks or traditional media to find content. Based on original data with a sample of college students, we find that while students use digital media to find music new to them, social networks and traditional media continue to play a very important role in the course of exploration. We also find that digital technology is used differently by different types of music consumers and draw distinctions between peer-to-peer services and browsing, with the former more likely to be used by students from higher socio-economic backgrounds who are opinion leaders in the realm of music. We conclude with observations about the nature of opinion leadership and music and argue that future research should examine more closely the links among the discovery and sharing of culture, opinion leadership and social recognition and status.\n|Authentic Link=http://webuse.org/pdf/TepperHargittai-PathwaysMusicExploration2009.pdf\n|Reference=Bakos (1998); Arthur et al.

Croatia became the EU’s 28th Member State on 1 July 2013. However, since not enough data for Croatia was available when the analysis was conducted in autumn 2012 and spring 2013, the study only includes the 27 pre-July 2013 Member States.\n\nThe study covers a broad range of IP rights – trade marks, patents, designs, copyright and Geographical Indications (GIs) – and considers a variety of economic indicators, in particular Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, external trade and wages. It makes no policy recommendations, as this is not within its scope. Instead, it is designed to provide evidence that can be used by policymakers in their work, and to serve as a basis for raising awareness of Intellectual Property among Europe’s citizens.\n\nThe study is intended to provide results that are comparable to those obtained for the US economy. The methodology used here is therefore closely related to that used in the pioneering study\npublished in March 2012 by the Economics and Statistics Administration in the US Department of\nCommerce and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n|Authentic Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/intellectual-property/docs/joint-report-epo-ohim-final-version_en.pdf\n|Link=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/intellectual-property/docs/joint-report-epo-ohim-final-version_en.pdf\n|Reference=Economics and Statistics Administration (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=IPR-intensive industries are defined as those having an above-average use of IPR per employee.\nThe present study shows that about half of European industries can be considered IPR‑intensive.\nIt should be emphasised, however, that all industries use IP rights to some extent. By focusing only on the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\n\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries.6 On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by IPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR‑dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\n\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth € 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU’s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus. IPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage premium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.\n\nIn addition to their direct employment contribution, IPR-intensive industries also generate employment in other, non‑IPR-intensive industries which supply them with goods and services as inputs to their production processes. Using the EU27 Input Output Tables, published by Eurostat, it is possible to calculate this indirect effect on employment in non‑IPR‑intensive industries. The result is summarised in table 2, which shows a breakdown by direct and indirect employment. Including the indirect jobs in the calculation implies that 35.1% of EU jobs are contributed by the IPR-intensive industries, directly and indirectly.\n\nBesides employment, IPR-intensive industries contribute to economic output, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Overall, almost 39% of EU GDP is generated in IPR-intensive industries, with trade mark-intensive industries accounting for 34%, design-intensive industries for 13%, patent-intensive industries for 14% and copyright and GI-intensive industries for smaller proportions. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed breakdown of these industries’ contributions to the national economies of the EU Member States.\n\nComparing the results of this EU study with those for the US reveals that the two economies have a similar structure, as is to be expected given their similar level of development. However, in terms of the contribution of IPR-intensive industries, the shares in employment and GDP are somewhat higher in the EU: 26% vs. 19% for employment and 39% vs. 35% for GDP. However, in both studies, trade mark-intensive industries account for the highest shares in both employment and GDP, followed by patents and copyright in the US and by designs, patents and copyright in the EU. Similarly, the wage premiums in IPR-intensive industries compared to other industries are similar: 41% in the EU and 42% in the US, with copyright-intensive and patent intensive industries having the highest premiums on both sides of the Atlantic.\nGiven that 39% of GDP (value added) in the economy and 26% of employment is generated in IPRintensive industries, the value added per employee is higher in IPR-intensive industries than in the rest of the economy. Economic theory suggests that, all else being equal, industries in which the average worker produces more value added can be expected to pay their workers higher wages than other industries. It is therefore of relevance to examine whether this higher value added is reflected in the relative wages in the IPR‑intensive industries.\n\nWages in IPR-intensive industries are indeed higher than in non-IPR‑intensive industries. The average weekly wage in IPR-intensive industries is € 715, compared with € 507 in non‑IPR‑intensive industries – a difference of 41%. This “wage premium” is 31% in design-intensive industries, 42% in trade mark-intensive industries, 46% in GI-intensive industries, 64% in patent-intensive industries and 69% in copyright-intensive industries.\n\nFinally, the role played by IPR-intensive industries in the EU’s external trade is examined. The bulk of EU trade is in IPR-intensive industries. It may be somewhat surprising at first glance that such a high share of imports is IPR-intensive. This is because even industries producing commodities such as energy are IPR-intensive, while on the other hand, many non-IPR-intensive activities are also non-tradable. For that reason, 88% of EU imports consist of products of IPR-intensive industries.\n\nHowever, an even higher share of EU exports, 90% is accounted for by IPR-intensive industries. The EU as a whole had a trade deficit of approximately €174 billion, or 1.4% of GDP. Since the IPR-intensive industries as a whole account for a higher share of EU exports than EU imports, they make a positive contribution to the Union’s trade position.

The surveys were conducted by Macquarie University for the Australia Council of the Arts. The data in this survey was collected in 2009 using the responses of over a thousand professional artists to a detailed questionnaire. The study uses census data to provide demographic information of the artist population in Australia and highlights changes since the previous studies, including a drop in the number of artists recording professional artist as their main occupation. Data from the survey highlights the income disparity between professional artists and the general population, with a mean average income of A$18,900 derived from the artist’s creative work. Survey data also highlights working patterns, time spent on artistic endeavours and career progression. Matters of financial security and income from non-arts sources are also reported. The study also highlights the contribution artists make with their artistic skills in non-artistic industries, and how digital technologies are changing the arts. The report is aimed at policy-makers, bureaucrats, arts organisations, artists themselves and the wider community.\n|Authentic Link=http://australiacouncil.gov.au/workspace/uploads/files/research/do_you_really_expect_to_get_pa-54325a3748d81.pdf\n|Link=http://australiacouncil.gov.au/workspace/uploads/files/research/do_you_really_expect_to_get_pa-54325a3748d81.pdf\n|Reference=Throsby (1982); Throsby (1983); Throsby and Hollister (2003); Throsby and Miller (1989); Throsby and Thompson (1994);\n|Plain Text Proposition=*Artists in general suffer from low income and financial security\n*The context of artistic practice is changing due to a more 'portfolio' style of working and also due to the ubiquity of digital technology\n*Financial security of professional artists is falling\n*There is a decline in the proportion of artists under 35\n*Artists increasingly practice their creative talents in no-artistic industries\n*Women are more likely to earn a low income or be unemployed as professional artists, as are artists from a Non English Speaking Background and artists with a disability\n*The rise previously observed in the numbers of professional artists has levelled off\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

This paper presents a theory of a streaming music business model consisting of two types of services provided by a monopolist. The first service, which offers access free of charge, is of low quality and financed by advertising. The second service charges its users and is of high quality. The analysis demonstrates that if users are highly tolerant of commercials, the monopolist benefits from advertising funding and hence charges a high price to users of the fee-based service to boost demand for the advertising supported service. The analysis addresses the welfare consequences of such a business model and shows it is an effective policy for combating digital piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624513000103\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2006a); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004); Resinger (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* This paper examines a monopolistic streaming music business model with two vertically differentiated types of services.\n* The low-quality service offers free access and is advertising based, while the high-quality service is fee based.\n* High tolerance of advertising benefits the monopolist and harms users.\n* Launching both types of services never leads to a socially desirable outcome.\n* Such a streaming music business model may be an effective means to combat digital piracy.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Ashcroft. We show that behavioral biases - namely, individuals' optimistic bias regarding their future longevity and their subadditive judgments in circumstances resembling the extant rule of copyright duration - explain the otherwise puzzling lifetime-plus-years basis for copyright protection given to individual authors, and reveal how this regime provides superior incentives to create. Thus, insofar as the provision of increased incentives to individual authors is socially desirable, a lifetime-plus-years rule is a more effective legal means of accomplishing this goal than a rule based on a fixed term of years of a comparable expected duration.\n|Authentic Link=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2347&context=llr\n|Link=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2347&context=llr\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Langevoort (1998); Drouhin (2001); Shavell (2002); Jolls (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The behavioral efficacy of a lifetime-plus-years regime does not apply to the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which merely extends the years component of an already existing lifetime-plus-years rule. \n* Drawing on empirical findings on intertemporal choice, as well as our preceding analysis of the lifetime-plus-years regime and our own experimental tests, we determine that the CTEA's prospective extension provides negligible additional incentives to individual authors. \n* The extension is unjustified on incentive-provision grounds, a finding of relevance to the Court's determination in Eldred v.

(1999). Copyright and economic incentives: an application to performers’ rights in the music industry. Kyklos, 52(3), 369-390.\n|Abstract=This paper contributes to the economic analysis of copyright in three ways: first, it draws a distinctiod between the general purpose of copyright law and the administration of the royalty system of payment for the use of copyrighted material; this leads to the principal-agent analysis of modes of payment. Secondly, this approach is applied to a specific topic, the change in copyright law in the form of the introduction of a new property right for performers in the UK that has come about as a result of the harmonisation programme of the European Union. Finally, new data were collected to assess the likely impact this change in law would have on performers\' earnings using the music industry as a case study. This is novel because there has been no previous attempt to apply empirical evidence to the analysis of copyright law. The paper therefore provides a framework for evaluating changes to copyright law.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1999.tb00223.x/abstract\n|Reference=Plant (1934); Landes and Posner (1989); Peacock & Weir (1975); Taylor & Towse (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The Main results of this study are:\n\n* There is an economic logic to the royalty system of payment for the use of copyright.\n\n* By adopting a principal-agent model of incentives to author and publisher, the trade-off between risk-bearing over the life of the copyrighted work, the amount of effort at marketing and maintaining the reputation of the work and the transaction costs inherent in the different payment methods is exposed.\n\n* The drafters of the Rental Directive attempted to counteract market forces by making some performers’ rights unwaivable.

"Copyright and Business Models in UK Music Publishing."\n|Abstract=The paper argues that the paradigmatic shift from the sale of printed music to exploiting and managing musical rights that took place in music publishing during the early years of the 20th century was due to the changing market rather than to changes in copyright law. On the one hand, copyright law was ineffectual in controlling piracy throughout the 19th century and on the other hand, performing rights were ignored by music publishers for over 70 years; these points suggest that copyright was not the main reason behind the success of the industry. Rather than leading entrepreneurially (the current view of dynamism in the creative industries), publishers ‘followed the money’ and adapted their business models only when new streams of income from new forms of exploitation through sound recording, broadcasting and film became available as a result of exogenous technical progress. Publishers were locked-in to sales revenue as their business model, though when switching to the new business model of rights management took place, the costs seem not to have been greatly significant.\n\nThe paper takes an historical approach to the development of music publishing viewed through the lens of present day issues. The research has resonance for the transition from sales to licensing digital works that is taking place in the creative industries today and puts into perspective the relative significance of market forces and copyright law in the process.\n|Link=http://www.create.ac.uk/publications/copyright-and-business-models-in-uk-music-publishing/; https://zenodo.org/record/34492/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2015-10.pdf\n|Reference=Humphries and Smith (1970);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The huge outlay on IT investment needed to keep track of digital use suggests that large\nenterprises will benefit from network and scale economies; large scale enterprises also are\nbetter able to pool risk and finance potential loss in superstar markets like those of music\npublishing.

The economic effects of digitization on the administration of musical copyrights. Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues 10.2 (2013): 55-67.\n|Abstract=Digitization has had a profound effect on the management of musical copyrights in terms of data requirements and has vastly increased the volume of transactions: both impacts have raised net costs of administration to collecting societies. This paper explores these points using information provided by PRS for Music, the UK’s collecting society managing musical rights and considers them in the wider context of moves on the political front to increase competition in rights management as well as to promote multi-territorial licensing within the EU. An important question for economists is whether the natural monopoly argument for single national collective rights management using blanket licensing still holds up with digitization of music and management of musical rights.

It analyses the conditions of the commercialization of music in an industry structure with, and without, a copyright regime. The paper's main concern is with the relationship between artists and publishers. The particular influence of the continental European, especially Austrian, copyright regime on the contractual design of publishing contracts and the music industry structure, and their differences from US norms, is discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691180802459971#.VbVGUfmCfIU\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/250889461_COPYRIGHT_CONTRACTS_AND_MUSIC_PRODUCTION\n|Reference=Musgrave (1969); Patterson (1990); Shapiro and Varian (1999); Tschmuck (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Music publishers lobbied for copyright legislation and created collecting societies  in order to exploit artists creative inputs using contracts which granted the publishers exclusive rights over the inputs.\n\nCopyright regime , in music publishing, leads to monopolistic competition,  oligopolistic structures and asymmetric market power on the side of music publishers.\nThe stronger party will dictate the terms of the agreement s thus contracts will include clauses which lead to dependence of authors on publishers/record companies.  \n\nThe rights of authors  granted by copyright will be expropriated if not protected by contractual law.\n\nIf contracts do not formally grant moral and financial rights and restrict potential exploitation gatekeepers will regulate innovation driving production to more of the same compared to creative experiments.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

First, a Web-based questionnaire was developed and placed on most popular Greek forums. Then, 300 Greek Internet users stated their opinions regarding digital music and the following downloading methods: 1) Http downloading, 2) P2P downloading, 3) Torrent downloading, and 4) Combined iTunes method. The results revealed that P2P programs are the first choice for downloading mp3. The responders were satisfied with the P2P’s easiness of use, the variety of songs and the no need to pay. However, they worried about P2P’s safety. Gender differences were identified in several areas. Music industry managers could consider these findings in their strategies to reach the consumers. Advertising companies could use the results to target differently male or female consumers.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.conta.uom.gr/conta/publications/PDF/gender%20differences%20in%20digital%20music%20distribution%20methods%20-%20P2P%20Networking%20and%20Applications.pdf; http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-009-0056-4#page-1\n|Reference=Thompsen and Vivien (2000); Heimrath and Goulding (2001); Mitina and Voiskounsky (2005); Yang and Lester (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Gender differences were identified in the following areas:\n# female Internet users are older than males;\n# more females still use old internet connection technologies than males;\n# females trust their computer knowledge less than males\n# females use the Internet less frequently than males\n# fewer females than males store their mp3 files\n# females possess smaller number of stored mp3 files than males\n# females use mp3 for different reasons than males\n* P2P is the most preferable method for both genders (54%).\t\n* Cost considerations weigh heavily on the decision to buy or pirate.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Our licensing system is founded on a view that the music marketplace requires a unique level of government regulation, much of it reflected in statutory licensing provisions of the Copyright Act. The Copyright Office believes that the time is ripe to question the existing paradigm for the licensing of musical works and sound recordings and consider meaningful change.\n\nThere is a widespread perception that our licensing system is broken. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned that they cannot make a living under the existing structure, which raises serious and systemic concerns for the future. Music publishers and performance rights organizations are frustrated that so much of their licensing activity is subject to government control, so they are constrained in the marketplace. Record labels and digital services complain that the licensing process is burdensome and inefficient, making it difficult to innovate.\n\nWhile there is general consensus that the system needs attention, there is less agreement as to what should be done. In this report, after reviewing the existing framework and stakeholders’ views, the Copyright Office offers a series of guiding principles and preliminary recommendations for change. The Office’s proposals are meant to be contemplated together, rather than individually. With this approach, the Office seeks to present a series of balanced tradeoffs among the interested parties to create a fairer, more efficient, and more rational system for all.\n|Authentic Link=http://copyright.gov/docs/musiclicensingstudy/copyright-and-the-music-marketplace.pdf\n|Link=http://copyright.gov/docs/musiclicensingstudy/copyright-and-the-music-marketplace.pdf\n|Reference=Kohn (2010); Peters (2005); Passman (2013);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The Copyright Office appreciates and agrees with the four grounding principles that were articulated by many during the course of this study, as discussed above. These are:\n* Music creators should be fairly compensated for their contributions;\n* The licensing process should be more efficient;\n* Market participants should have access to authoritative data to identify and license sound recordings and musical works;\n* Usage and payment information should be transparent and accessible to rightsowners.\n\nAs much as there may be consensus on these points, however, the opposite could be said of stakeholders’ views as to how best to achieve them. Having considered the plethora of issues that plague our current licensing system—and how they might practically be addressed—the Office has identified some additional principles that it believes should also guide any process of reform. These are:\n* Government licensing processes should aspire to treat like uses of music alike;\n* Government supervision should enable voluntary transactions while still supporting collective solutions;\n* Ratesetting and enforcement of antitrust laws should be separately managed and addressed;\n* A single, market‐oriented ratesetting standard should apply to all music uses under statutory licenses.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

This Report addresses two circumstances in which the accomplishment of that goal may be hindered under the current law due to practical obstacles preventing good faith actors from securing permission to make productive uses of copyrighted works.  First, with respect to orphan works, referred to as 'perhaps the single greatest impediment to creating new works,' a user's ability to seek permission or to negotiate licensing terms is compromised by the fact that, despite his or her diligent efforts, the user cannot identify or locate the copyright owner. Second, in the case of mass digitization – which involves making reproductions of many works, as well as possible efforts to make the works publicly accessible – obtaining permission is essentially impossible, not necessarily because of a lack of identifying information or the inability to contact the copyright owner, but because of the sheer number of individual permissions required.\n|Authentic Link=http://copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf\n|Link=http://copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf\n|Reference=Samuelson (2011); Ginsburg (2014); Hansen (2012);\n|Plain Text Proposition=After reviewing stakeholder responses and international systems, the Copyright Office recommends two separate solutions for mass digitization and orphan works.  Due to the widespread problem of receiving permission for orphan work use, the Copyright Office recommends limiting liability on infringement for orphan works after diligent search.  For mass digitization, the issue centres on market efficiency rather than lack of information.  Thus the Copyright Office proposes legislative reform (with regulatory flexibility) based on extended collective licensing.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

See Pub. L. No. 111-175, 124 Stat. 1218 (2010) (hereinafter “STELA”). The legislation extended the term of the Section 119 satellite distant signal statutory license for another five years, modified the Section 111 cable statutory license and the Section 122 satellite local-into-local statutory license in several respects, and provided updates to account for changes resulting from the nationwide transition to digital television. STELA also directed the Register of Copyrights (hereinafter “Copyright Office” or “Office”) to submit recommendations to Congress to achieve the phase-out and eventual repeal of Sections 111, 119, and 122, including proposals for timing and marketplace alternatives.\nIn these proceedings, the Office floated three broad alternatives to the statutory\nlicenses currently in place: (1) sublicensing; (2) collective licensing; and (3) direct licensing, and explored with stakeholders certain fundamental questions – among these, how such options might function in an open marketplace and the benefits and drawbacks of each model. The proceedings also highlighted the fact that, although the statutory licenses at issue are copyright provisions, they are intertwined with equally complex provisions of communications law and policy – the implications of which are outside the expertise of the Copyright Office and require further consideration by Congress.\n|Authentic Link=http://copyright.gov/reports/section302-report.pdf\n|Link=http://copyright.gov/reports/section302-report.pdf\n|Reference=Hargreaves (2011); Litman (2010); Katz (2005); Broussard (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The Office supports a free market for licensing the retransmission of broadcast\ntelevision programming, finds that there are workable marketplace alternatives to the existing statutory licensing system, and suggests a phase-out approach that not only respects the rights of subscribers but also recognizes the concerns of all the affected parties. The recommendations set forth herein reflect all of these considerations.The Copyright Office hereby makes the following recommendations to effectuate a phase-out of\nthe statutory licenses:\n\n• Copyright owners should be permitted to develop marketplace licensing options to replace the provisions of Sections 111, 119 and 122, working with broadcasters, cable operators, satellite carriers, and other licensees, while taking into account consumer demands.\n\n• Business models based on sublicensing, collective licensing and/or direct licensing are largely undeveloped in the broadcast retransmission context, but they are feasible alternatives to securing the public performance rights necessary to retransmit copyrighted content.\n\n• The options of sublicensing, collective licensing, and direct licensing do not represent the entire universe of possibilities, are not mutually exclusive, and will not remain static. Business models may emerge that incorporate these concepts in part or in combination, and technology will continuously inform the practices of both licensors and licensees. Over time, marketplace licensing should evolve in a variety of innovative ways, subject to investment and experimentation in the marketplace.\n\n• The Copyright Office recommends that Congress provide a date-specific trigger for the phase-out and eventual repeal of the distant signal licenses, building in sufficient time for a measured and orderly transition period.\n\n• Before determining the date-specific trigger and transition period for the phase-out of the distant signal licenses, the Copyright Office recommends that Congress evaluate the concerns of stakeholders who operate with limited resources in the broadcast programming distribution chain and determine whether special consideration is advisable.\n\n• During the transition period, the Section 111, 119, and 122 statutory licenses should not apply to any broadcast station that has obtained the rights to retransmit all of the content carried on its signal, provided that the local broadcast station forgoes its mandatory carriage rights under the United States Copyright Office STELA § 302 REPORT 140 must-carry and carry-one carry-all provisions of the Communications Act. This “station-bystation” option would apply to all broadcast stations, including those in distant markets. Under this option, MVPDs would be required to negotiate directly with the broadcast station for carriage of the programming on the broadcast signal.\n\n• The Copyright Office recommends that Congress delay the phase-out and repeal of the local\nsignal licenses to a later time. This approach would provide stakeholders with an opportunity to test new business models with the least likelihood of disruption to consumers, and give Congress the advantage of drawing on that experience when considering when and how to address the local signal licenses.\n\n• The Copyright Office recommends that Congress carefully consider the communications law and\npolicy implications of repealing the statutory licensing system.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

They interact with equally complex provisions of communications law and regulations. The Copyright Office recommends that Congress consider and, as appropriate, address these provisions in tandem with the recommendations described in this Report.\n|Description of Data=In the course of preparing this Report, the Office met with many stakeholders, including\ncopyright owners and representatives from the broadcast, cable and satellite industries, as well as with the Federal Communications Commission, both to discuss pertinent issues (including timing and implementation concerns) and to identify the kinds of private licensing models used in the marketplace today (or which could be used reasonably soon) to acquire and retransmit broadcast and cable content.

Indeed, U.S. copyright law derives\nfundamentally from the principle that authors’ interests are inseparable from the broader public interest. While “[t]he immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an ‘author’s’ creative labor,” the “ultimate aim is . . . to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.” Accordingly, to the extent that the current copyright system is not working effectively for authors – or is disfavoring a discrete class of authors – Congress should be concerned.\n\nIn the framework of the resale royalty discussions, the authors at issue are certain visual\nartists, including painters, illustrators, sculptors, and photographers (hereinafter “visual artists” or “artists”). Based on the information and comments provided during the preparation of this report, as well as the Office’s independent research, the Office agrees that, under the current legal system, visual artists are uniquely limited in their ability to fully benefit from the success of their works over time. The distinctive nature of the creation and marketing of visual art has not changed since the Office’s main study on the topic, published in 1992. At the same time, recent developments – including in particular the adoption of resale royalty laws by more than thirty additional countries since the Office’s prior report – would seem to warrant renewed consideration of the issue.\n\nIn general, visual artists do not share in the long-term financial success of their works.\nInstead, the financial gains from the resale of their works inure primarily to third parties such as auction houses, collectors, and art galleries. Moreover, the income typically available to other authors through reproduction and derivative uses of their works is more limited for artists. Although the Internet has provided artists with greater opportunities to exploit derivative images and/or sell mass-produced copies of their works, stakeholders agree that “for most visual artists . . . the amounts involved in reproduction or representation are generally insignificant.” Indeed, it appears to be common ground that reproduction rights represent a “very minor aspect of [most artists’] careers” and that the first sale of a work is “the main or exclusive source of income for almost all American artists.”\n\nThe Copyright Office agrees that these factors place many visual artists at a material\ndisadvantage vis-à-vis other authors, and therefore the Office supports congressional\nconsideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite,8 which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party. A large and growing number of countries around the world – more than seventy in total – now follow that approach. Other potential responses might include the facilitation of voluntary initiatives among stakeholders in the art market, amending the copyright law to give artists a continuing economic interest in their works through, for example, greater interests in public display or commercial rental rights, and increased federal grants for visual art programs. \n\nThat said, an “information problem” in the art market – something that many have acknowledged – does present certain challenges. Any assessment of the treatment of visual artists under U.S. law suffers from a lack of independently verifiable data about the operation of the art market and a resulting difficulty in determining whether a resale royalty in particular would truly operate to place artists on equal footing with other authors. At the same time, the Office recognizes that many of the arguments against the right are overblown. Moreover, according to the most recent studies, a number of the adverse consequences that this Office’s previous report predicted might follow from implementation of the right have not materialized in countries that have adopted droit de suite since that time. Accordingly, the Office finds no clear impediment to implementation of a resale royalty right in the United States and supports the right as one alternative to address the disparity in treatment of artists under the copyright law.\n|Authentic Link=http://copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf\n|Link=http://copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf\n|Reference=United States Copyright Office (1992); Towse (2011); Froschauer (2008); Raustiala and Sprigman (2011); Perlmutter (1991-1992);\n|Plain Text Proposition=• Although visual artists possess the same exclusive rights under copyright law as other\nauthors, they are disadvantaged as a practical matter by certain factors endemic to the\ncreation of works that are produced in singular form (or in very limited copies) and are\nvalued for their scarcity. There are sound policy reasons to address this inequity,\nincluding the constitutionally-rooted objective to incentivize the creation and\ndissemination of artistic works.\n\n• While a resale royalty could be one of many factors affecting the location of auctions and other art sales, there is no evidence to conclusively establish that it would harm the U.S.visual art market. Studies produced since this Office last examined the issue in 1992\nbelie earlier assumptions that a resale royalty would substantially reduce prices in the\nprimary art market or shift the secondary art market away from the United States.\n\n• Although adoption of a resale royalty right is one option to address the disparate\ntreatment of artists under the law, it is not the only option, and more deliberation is\nnecessary to determine if it is the best option. The Office’s 1992 report highlighted the\nfact that resale royalties appear to benefit only an extremely small number of artists.\nCurrent studies and reports remain consistent with this view. In light of the potentially\nlimited benefits, the costs of the law (e.g., administration and enforcement), while not\ninsurmountable, suggest that Congress should approach this issue with some caution.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

Unfortunately, and perhaps ironically, as the rate of infringement has increased, so too have the barriers to pursuing copyright claims in the federal courts. These barriers are largely practical: federal litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and therefore out of reach for many copyright owners. The problem is especially vexing in the context of small claims, where the injury may be limited or difficult to measure. If exclusive rights are unenforceable, they are weakened as the pillars of the copyright law, and public respect for our nation’s creativity is eroded in turn. The problem of modest-sized copyright claims, on the one hand, and costly enforcement, on the other, appears to be especially acute for individual creators. \n\nIn comments submitted to the Copyright Office in the course of this study, the Graphic Artists Guild wrote that “[a]s a practical matter, except for large corporate copyright owners, our current copyright laws are virtually unenforceable when it comes to the infringement of visual works.” In a similar vein, American Photographic Artists explained that “the current system deters authors from asserting their rights, renders these cases difficult for any attorney to take on, and encourages copyright infringement by all phases of society.” The Alliance for Visual Artists pointed out that “[t]he traditional method of protecting copyrights … is simply impracticable for a small business photographer with limited income.” Observing that “[w]e weaken markets for valuable goods at our collective peril,” the Authors Guild reported that a majority of authors surveyed saw the need forthat while “[s]uch small claims and random infringements may seem unimportant, … taken in the aggregate, they have an effect on the livelihoods of individual creators akin to the infamous torture ‘death by a thousand cuts.’” \n\nCreators are not alone in voicing these concerns. Citing the “hindrances that currently exist in preventing copyright owners from pursuing copyright claims of relatively small economic value,” the American Bar Association’s Section of Intellectual Property Law offered recommendations in support of “a much needed avenue for small copyright claims adjudication.” Organizations that provide pro bono assistance to lower-income artists, such as California Lawyers for the Arts and the New York-based Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, emphasized what they saw as a pressing need for alternatives to federal litigation. \n\nFinally, the frustrations of those seeking to defend against claims of infringement – who\nthemselves may be smaller actors and who also face high litigation costs – cannot be overlooked. The Copyright Office trusts that the findings and recommendations of this Report will be helpful to Congress as it continues to explore the issue of small copyright claims.\n|Authentic Link=http://copyright.gov/docs/smallclaims/usco-smallcopyrightclaims.pdf\n|Link=http://copyright.gov/docs/smallclaims/usco-smallcopyrightclaims.pdf\n|Reference=Nimmer (2013); McCarthy (2013); Beisner (2010); Samuelson and Wheatland (2009); Hargreaves (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=In brief summary, the Report makes the following recommendations:\n\n• Congress should create a centralized tribunal within the Copyright Office, which would\nadminister proceedings through online and teleconferencing facilities without the\nrequirement of personal appearances. The tribunal would be staffed by three\nadjudicators, two of whom would have significant experience in copyright law – together\nhaving represented or presided over the interests of both owners and users of copyrighted\nworks – with the third to have a background in alternative dispute resolution.\n\n• The tribunal would be a voluntary alternative to federal court. Its focus would be on\nsmall infringement cases valued at no more than $30,000 in damages. Copyright owners\nwould be required to have registered their works or filed an application before bringing\nan action. They would be eligible to recover either actual or statutory damages up to the\n$30,000 cap, but statutory damages would be limited to $15,000 per work (or $7,500 for\na work not registered by the normally applicable deadline for statutory damages).\n\n• Claimants who initiated a proceeding would provide notice of the claim to responding\nparties, who would need to agree to the process, either through an opt-out mechanism or\nby affirmative written consent. Respondents would be permitted to assert all relevant\ndefenses, including fair use, as well as limited counterclaims arising from the infringing\nconduct at issue. Certain DMCA-related matters relating to takedown notices, including\nclaims of misrepresentation, could also be considered, and parties threatened with an\ninfringement action could seek a declaration of noninfringement.\n\n• Parties would provide written submissions and hearings would be conducted through\ntelecommunications facilities. Proceedings would be streamlined, with limited discovery\nand no formal motion practice. A responding party’s agreement to cease infringing\nactivity could be considered by the tribunal and reflected in its determination. The\ntribunal would retain the discretion to dismiss without prejudice any claim that it did not\nbelieve could fairly be adjudicated through the small claims process.\n\n• Determinations of the small claims tribunal would be binding only with respect to the\nparties and claims at issue and would have no precedential effect. They would be subject\nto limited administrative review for error and could be challenged in federal district court\nfor fraud, misconduct, or other improprieties. Final determinations could be filed in\nfederal court, if necessary, to ensure their enforceability.\n|FundamentalIssue=2.

(2010). Legal, economic and cultural aspects of file sharing. Communications & Strategies, (77), 35-54.\n|Abstract=This contribution seeks to identify the short and long-term economic and cultural effects of file sharing on music, films and games, while taking into account the legal context and policy developments. The short-term implications examined concern direct costs and benefits to society, whereas the long-term impact concerns changes in the industry's business models as well as in cultural diversity and the accessibility of content. It observes that the proliferation of digital distribution networks combined with the availability of digital technology among consumers has broken the entertainment industries' control over the access to their products. Only part of the decline in music sales can be attributed to file sharing. Despite the losses for the music industry, the increased accessibillity of culture renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive. As a consequence the entertainment industries, particularly the music industry, have to explore new models to sustain their business.\n|Authentic Link=https://ideas.repec.org/a/idt/journl/cs7703.html\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1809696\n|Reference=Huygen, Helberger, Poort, Rutten and Van Eijk (2009); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Blackburn (2004); Liebowitz (2006); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of the study:\n\n*Turnover in the recorded music industry is in decline, but only part of this decline can be attributed to file sharing. \n\n*Conversely, only a small fraction of the content exchanged through file sharing networks comes at the expense of industry turnover. This renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive.\n\n*For example, the authors state that the consumer surplus created by music sharing in the Netherlands amounts to an estimated minimum of €200 million per year; a conservative estimate. At most half this amount is generated at the expense of the producer surplus and therefore constitutes a transfer of welfare. The remainder constitutes welfare gains.\n\n*The film industry is feeling the file-sharing pain less than is the music business, but this looks about to change as broadband is rolled out further. \n\n*The 'digitally native' games industry would seem better positioned to respond to the impact of file sharing, although some segments of the market, particularly the one for PC games, witnesses effects similar to the music industry. \n\n*The survey held among Dutch Internet users has shown that file sharing is here to stay and that people who download are at the same time important customers of the entertainment industry; therefore criminalising them makes no sense.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This strategy resulted in the current backlash, providing space for a new entrant establishing a major brand in the online music business: Apple's iTunes. \n\n*Reinvention of the business model looks like the only way out for the traditional players in the music industry. The music economy appears to be facing a shift in spending away from recordings to concert tickets and, to a lesser degree, merchandise. The advance of so called 360-degree artist contracts is a step towards greater diversification of sources of income and underlines the clear connection that exists between various revenue sources in different music markets: recordings, live music and merchandise. \n\n*The entertainment industry should step outside the box of the traditional value chain and venture into a host of other markets through the creation of value networks. \n\n*A strategy that focuses solely on lawsuits and digital rights management (DRM) is not the best response, in particular as it remains to be seen whether a fully authorised, paid-for downloading market would generate sufficient revenues to stay in business. Even in a hypothetical future without file sharing, a hybrid business model would appear to be the solution.\n\n*And so the entertainment industry will have to work actively towards innovation on all fronts. New models worth developing, for example, are those that seek to achieve commercial diversification or that match supply and end-user needs more closely. In such a context, criminalising large parts of the population makes no sense.

But this study’s data also show the process commonly being used for other purposes: to create leverage in a competitive marketplace, to protect rights not given by copyright, and to stifle criticism, commentary and fair use.\n\n* These unanticipated or unintended uses of the process are having a continuous and perhaps unquantifiable effect on public discourse. Doing a more detailed check on notices would often result in an assessment of risk of secondary liability in a "gray" situation- exactly what OSPs hoped to  avoid through  legal safe harbors.\n\n* In theory, such OSP behaviors might become a consumer choice-point, with consumers  choosing OSPs more likely to resist overbroad takedowns, but the lack of public discussion of this issue suggests that consumers have little awareness of the issue or means to compare OSP behavior on this issue.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Available at SSRN 2405015\n|Abstract=Authorship, and hence, initial ownership of copyrighted works is oftentimes controlled by the 1976 Copyright Act’s work made for hire doctrine. This doctrine states that works created by employees within the scope of their employment result in the employer owning the copyright. One key determination in this analysis is whether the hired party is an employee or independent contractor. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court, in CCNV v. Reid, answered the question of how employees are distinguished from independent contractors by setting forth a list of factors courts should consider. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not give further guidance on how to balance these factors. Three years later, in 1992, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided Aymes v. Bonelli and noted that not all factors are equally weighted and that five of the factors would “be significant in virtually every situation.” This analysis was supported by looking at all the work made for hire cases decided in the three year period since Reid – six cases in total. This Article expands in both scope and time what the Second Circuit did in Aymes and systematically analyzes how courts have utilized the factors in the twenty-five years since Reid. In particular, this study has identified the universe of cases where the courts have decided whether a hired party was an employee or independent contractor and uses the data from these cases to describe what factors appear to be the most and least important in reaching these conclusions. Based on the results of this study, this Article proposes a continuum of importance, which graphically illustrates the relative importance of each factor.\n|Authentic Link=http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1225&context=ua_law_publications\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2405015\n|Reference=Fisk (2003); Beebe (2006); Garon and Ziff (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Although the Supreme Court cast the rejected “right to control” test as focusing on controlling the product as opposed to controlling the manner and means of production, it is questionable whether there is a meaningful difference between them.\n\n* Even assuming the Supreme Court had correctly understood the “right to control” test, the results of this study suggest that the right to control is unimportant.\n\n* The Supreme Court’s rejection of the “right to control” test is consistent with the results of this study. However, because the Supreme Court misunderstood the test, the reason for the consistency has little to do with the Court’s rationale for rejecting the test.\n\n* The results of this study should assist attorneys in evaluating their clients’ cases and giving more informed recommendations about whether to settle a dispute and for how much. Focusing on the most important factors can provide increased predictability and certainty.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

On the other hand, extending the term makes the production of intellectual property more profitable, increasing the supply of works. The optimal term balances out these two effects. \n* A clever monopolist might use pre-emptive pricing and set an initial price low enough to discourage sharing. In the limit-pricing equilibrium, the surplus is shared between the monopolist and the consumer. This outcome is due to the fact that the possibility of sharing operates like a competitor for the monopolist, constraining the price that it can charge. Since the monopolist’s price and profit is increasing in the transactions cost of sharing, the monopolist would like these transactions costs to be as large as possible. Hence, it would be interested in seeing greater enforcement of antipiracy laws, technologies that make it costly to copy and similar measure that make copying more costly to consumers.\n* Now that most information is born digital and that digital information is typically very easy to copy and distribute, it is conceivable that copyright laws may become almost impossible to enforce. Some business models might help sellers supporting themselves in an environment without effective copyright: 1) Make the original cheaper than a copy; 2) Make a copy more expensive than the original; 3) Sell physical complements; 4) Sell information complements; 5) Subscriptions; 6) Sell a personalized version; 7) Selling works with digital fingerprints (encoding the identity of the purchaser); 8) Advertise oneself; 9) Advertise other things; 10) Monitoring; 11) Site licenses; 12) Media tax; 13) Ransom; 14) Pure public provision; 15) Prizes, awards and commissions\n- Copyright is a second-best solution to intellectual property provision. Perhaps the ultimate saving grace is that the same technological advances that are making digital content inexpensive to copy are also helping to reduce the fixed cost of content creation. Hundreds of thousands of people are giving away digital content, from blogs to garage video to open source software. The increased availability of content due to the reduction in the cost of creating and distributing it will presumably increase competition and reduce the price consumers pay for legitimate access to content.\n- It is highly unlikely that free content alone will meet all of society’s needs for content. However, free content together with some combination of the business models described in this work and traditional copyright may do an adequate job of satisfying society’s demand for information goods.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2003). Open source software and the “private-collective” innovation model: Issues for organization science. Organization science, 14(2), p. 209-223\n|Abstract=Currently, two models of innovation are prevalent in organization science. The “private investment” model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection. The “collective action” model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound “private-collective” model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the “best of both worlds” under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for scholars in organization science. We offer some details regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source software development processes.\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.2.209.14992\n|Link=http://web.mit.edu/people/evhippel/papers/Private-Collective%20Model%20OS.pdf\n|Reference=Demsetz (1967); Olson (1967); Lerner and Tirole (2002); von Hippel (1988); Benford (1993);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* There are many interesting puzzles in open source software research projects that can trigger the interest of organization scholars for years to come.

Information Economics and Policy, 22(4), 306-314.\n|Abstract=A growing empirical literature examines the relationship between music file sharing and legal purchases of music, but existing studies examine the period before consumers had attractive legal digital a la carte options. The iTunes Music Store has grown quickly since its appearance in 2003, and digital music now accounts for a third of US recorded music sales. Using two new surveys of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates in 2009 and 2010, we ask how music file sharing and sales displacement operate in the iTunes era, when the alternative to file sharing is purchasing individual songs, rather than entire albums. We find large amounts of file sharing in this population. Respondents have more stolen than paid music, but the music obtained via file sharing is, for the most part, low-valuation music which the respondents would likely not have purchased. The rate of sales displacement implied by the relationship between stolen and purchased music across respondents in both samples is between −0.15 and −0.3. That is, an additional song stolen reduces paid consumption by between a third and a sixth of song. Perhaps surprisingly, this is about the same as the CD sales displacement rate found for the pre-iTunes era using a similar empirical approach on a similar study population.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624510000260\n|Reference=Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Zentner (2006); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* There is high rate of file sharing among the sample in 2009 and 2010, to the extent that respondents have more stolen than paid music.

Information Economics and Policy, 21(2), 158-168.\n|Abstract=In the past few years, YouTube and other sites for sharing video files over the Internet have vaulted from obscurity to places of centrality in the media landscape. The files available at YouTube include a mix of user-generated video and clips from network television shows. Networks fear that availability of their clips on YouTube will depress television viewing. But unauthorized clips are also free advertising for television shows. As YouTube has grown quickly, major networks have responded by making their content available at their own sites. This paper examines the effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution on television viewing between 2005 and 2007 using a survey of Penn students on their tendencies to watch television series on television as well as on the web. The results provide a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use YouTube and related sites. While I find some evidence of substitution of web viewing for conventional television viewing, time spent viewing programming on the web - 4 hours per week - far exceeds the reduction in weekly traditional television viewing of about 25 minutes. Overall time spent on network-controlled viewing (television plus network websites) increased by 1.5 hours per week.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624508000723\n|Link=http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6586822.pdf\n|Reference=Liebowitz (1985); Blackburn (2004); Liebowitz (2006); Pennington (2006); Helft and Fabrikant (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- The empirical literature on file sharing in music and movies has, for the most part, found depressing effects of web distribution on legal sales. This study too finds significant depressing effects of web distribution on conventional television viewing, but it also documents largely offsetting positive relationships, reflecting complementarity. \n\n- Overall, conventional television viewing is reduced slightly in this sample, while overall viewing of network programming rises substantially. Hours spent viewing television programming overall nearly double with web distribution. While conventional television viewing falls by about 5 percent, this is more than offset by increases in time spent viewing network-authorized web programming.\n\n- The networks’ own web distribution has smaller but similar effects as the \nunauthorized distribution on conventional television viewing. Of course, in the network efforts, the network broadcasts advertising, so the loss the traditional viewing is at least partially offset by online ad revenue.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

(2011). Music and dance: beyond copyright text?.\n|Abstract=Are experiential, experimental forms of music and dance beyond protection by copyright? If they are, how might these art forms best be protected by cultural policy and cultural economics? These were the key questions that we set out to investigate with the support of a Beyond Text grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council and with the help of our network members where together we formed an interdisciplinary team comprised of experts in copyright law, cultural policy, cultural economics, dance and musical composition. Through a series of interviews with musicians, singers, songwriters, composers, dancers, choreographers and others involved in the music industry and dance community we came to the conclusion that these types of works are both before copyright and beyond copyright. They are before copyright because what matters to the majority of those involved is the process of creation – which itself is constantly evolving – rather than the product – the protected work once fixed. They are beyond copyright because key aspects of the performance involve contributions which are not recognised by copyright, and because there is much about the performance which simply cannot be captured in the mechanical sense. As a result, policy intervention, which focuses on the product rather than the process, becomes problematic. This article suggests a series of practical recommendations made by our interviewees for ways in which the art forms may be supported into the future.\n|Authentic Link=http://hdl.handle.net/10036/3357; https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/3357\n|Reference=Schlesinger  (2009); Schlesinger and Waelde (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In dance, there is much about both the process and the performance that interviewees think cannot be captured. For music, the process is also crucial. A key issue is to find something “extra” that will draw a life audience. \n* Because of a lack of resources, there is much contemporary music and dance that will not be captured, as it lacks a market. Once it is captured, then if the work is of a recognized kind, it will be accorded copyright protection. \n* A performer, on the other hand, is recognized as a performer in the absence of a performance being fixed. The lower parameters of the right accorded to performers, both unfixed and once fixed, which protects only the fixation itself and not the underlying performance against copying, seems much more suited to music and dance subcultures than does copyright with its expansive property right. The drawback is that performers’ income streams in respect of a performance are significantly lower by comparison with copyright owners’.\n* On an individual level, our interviewees generally live in a culture of precarious production. The overwhelming majority had ‘portfolio careers’. In other words, they could not live by their art alone, but rather had to seek out other income streams. These included commercial work for third parties and, rather often, teaching. Public funding (e.g. via various arts agencies) was important for survival, although the constant need to fill application forms and justify the works could detract from the production of the work and this was not seen as a long-term strategy, more of an occasional help for a specific project.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The creative process prior to fixation is of prime importance and is thus before copyright; and there is much about a performance that defies fixation or is of the kind not recognised by the criteria required for copyright protection, and is thus beyond copyright.\n* Going forwards, and in a time of stretched public funding, knowing where to target limited resources for maximum return is going to be of vital importance. Appreciating that increased or even existing protection by copyright is of only marginal importance to experiential, experimental forms of music and dance, and that other initiatives might have a greater impact in supporting the art forms, opens the terms of debate as to what new strategies of targeted support might be developed.\n|Description of Data=Primary data include information gathered during a dancers focus group in London with interviews conducted on various performers.

This study attempts to employ the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the social identity theory to investigate the antecedents of downloading pop music illegally from the Internet, the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music, and the moderating effects of idolatry. Data were collected from 350 teenagers in Northern Taiwan through questionnaire interviews conducted in city centers where teenagers gather. The results of partial least squares (PLS) analyses reconfirm the explanatory power of the TPB model with regard to the pop music illegal downloading behavior. However, it is interesting to note that the intention to illegally download music does not have a significant influence on the intention to buy music. This finding contradicts our common intuitions. Further analyses also reveal that idolatry moderates the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music. For teenagers with high idolatry, a higher music downloading intention results in a lower buying intention. One possible explanation is the price of music CDs. Several interviews were also held to verify our results. Implications and a discussion are then provided.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0027-y#page-1\n|Reference=Bhattacharjee et al.

This implies that the intention to illegally download music does not necessarily suppress the individual’s intention to buy CDs. This contradicts the claim that music downloading decreases CD sales, thus implying the importance of the moderating effect of idolatry.\n* Finally, “idolatry” is significantly positively related to the “intention to buy music.” When the moderating effect of “idolatry” is high, downloading behavior decreases teenagers’ buying intention.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Therefore, building a negative attitude to illegal music downloading and creating a consensus among peers is one of the methods to prevent piracy. Strengthening teenagers’ understanding of copyright and ethical education is another possible solution. \n* If the music industry cannot meet teenagers needs in buying licensed music CDs, they may resort to acquiring music through illegal channels. \n* Young people have very high price elasticity of demand for music since they are usually economically dependent. Hence, differential pricing could be a useful marketing strategy.\n|Description of Data=350 mail-intercept personal surveys were collected from randomly selected teenagers in several metropolitan areas of Northern Taiwan from January 2006 to March 2006.

Based on a survey of 552 college students, results revealed that students who believed that illegal downloading would help save money and was convenient and those who did not want to be termed as being afraid of risk were more likely to download illegally, whereas those who had illegality concerns and high moral standards were less likely to download illegally. In addition, perceived social approval for downloading, but not the perceived frequency of others’ downloading behaviors, predicted intentions to download. This study argues that the integration of the three theoretical frameworks provides more meaningful, yet parsimonious guidance for designing antipiracy campaigns.\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/258173678_Toward_a_detailed_understanding_of_illegal_digital_downloading_intentions_An_extended_theory_of_planned_behavior_approach; http://nms.sagepub.com/content/13/4/663.abstract\n|Reference=Rosenberger (2009); Cenite et al (2009); Cronan and Al-Rafee (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=There are 4 research questions:\n# What attitude functions will emerge for illegal digital downloading through a P2P application?\n# Which attitude functions will predict intentions to engage in illegal downloading in the future?\n# What norms will emerge for illegal downloading through a P2P application?\n# Which norms will predict intentions to engage in illegal downloading in the future?\n\nIn general the research shows that college students who are motivated by utilitarian reasons (e.g. costs and convenience) and those who do not want to be termed as being afraid of risk are more likely to engage in illegal downloading, whereas those who have high moral and ethical standards and those who have illegality concerns are less likely to engage in illegal downloading.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The immorality of illegal downloading: The role of anticipated guilt and general emotions. Computers in Human Behavior, 28(1), 153-159.\n|Abstract=To extend previous cognition-based illegal downloading research, this project postulates that anticipated guilt, general emotions, attitudes, and norms collectively determine intentions to download digital files illegally. Our findings indicate that college students were more likely to download if they had more favorable attitudes, perceived greater social approval, and perceived more control over illegal downloading. More importantly, this study reveals that college students generally felt a low level of anticipated guilt toward illegal downloading. Anticipated guilt was a significant, negative predictor of intentions to download among those who engaged in illegal downloading in the previous 6 months, but not among those did not. General anticipated emotions predicted intentions to download among the whole sample. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001762\n|Reference=Ajzen (1991); Armitage and Conner (2001); Steenhaut and Van Kenhove (2006); Taylor, Ishida and Wallace (2009); Ajzen and Fishbein (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This article is an attempt to examine the emotional aspect of illegal file sharing by examining the influence of guilt, a moral emotion, on intentions to engage in illegal digital downloading or digital piracy. It examines the moderating role of past downloading behavior on the relationship between anticipated guilt/emotions and intentions, which has not been examined in the illegal downloading context, by casting light on the means and standard deviations of guilt and general emotions among those who engaged in digital piracy and among those who rarely or never downloaded on both the emotional and cognitive variables. More specifically, this article shows that: \n\n* Demographic variables, such as gender, race, and residential status, did not predict intentions to download in the next 2 months and were not included in the final results. Past behavior was a significant predictor of intentions, showing that those who downloaded in the past 6 months were more likely to download in the future than those who did not.\n\n* Those who downloaded had higher intentions to download than those who never downloaded or who downloaded 6 months ago.\n\n* Unlike anticipated guilt, which only predicts intentions for the downloaders, anticipated general emotions predict intentions to engage in illegal downloading for the whole sample. Thus, the influence of these positive general emotions does not depend on the appraisal of previous events or previous behavior.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

We develop a structural model and test it using survey data from a prime demographic set of respondents who engage in music piracy. Considering behavioral heterogeneity, we employ a factor mixture modeling technique to classify respondents into different groups that highlight distinct patterns of social learning influences. We find that the differential effects of social learning factors on obtaining and sharing persist across these groups. We further utilize demographic variables to profile members in each group for segmentation insights. From a theoretical perspective, our findings advance the understanding of music piracy and suggest the importance of separating obtaining from sharing activities when studying piracy. From a managerial perspective, our research provides new avenues for managers and policymakers to design targeted incentives to curtail music piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222280310?journalCode=mmis20#preview; http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220591355_Same_Coin_Different_Sides_Differential_Impact_of_Social_Learning_on_Two_Facets_of_Music_Piracy\n|Reference=Brown, Sellen, and Geelhoed (2001); Condry (2004);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Unauthorized obtaining and unauthorized sharing are shaped differently by the same set of social learning variables. \n* All four social learning variables (differential association, definitions of music piracy, differential reinforcement, and imitation) have significant impact on unauthorized obtaining as predicted by social learning theory, while only two (differential association and imitation) exert significant influence on unauthorized sharing. \n* The impact of definitions and differential reinforcement on obtaining are significantly larger than that on sharing, whereas the reverse pattern holds for the effects of imitation and differential association. \n* Differential reinforcement is an important preventative mechanism of illegal obtaining; however, one’s sharing behavior is more likely to be shaped via differential association with peers who engage in music piracy and imitation of their behavior. \n* Intervention and prevention programs may be more effective when combined with consumer segmentation strategies. \n* The findings of this study indicate the significance of developing diverse strategies to curtail distinct aspects of music piracy.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

This can be done by setting up good examples among college students for them to follow, through successful counseling and intervention strategies designed to prevent students from associating with pirating groups, and by taking specific measures to break an individuals’ association with pirating peers. \n* Since unlawful obtaining is primarily motivated through the realization of personal benefits or avoidance of personal losses, it is greatly affected by definitions of music piracy and differential reinforcement. Policymakers can achieve this by developing effective educational programs to change individuals’ definitions of music piracy, shape their conceptions of morality and legitimacy regarding music piracy, and successfully create a normative culture among groups where each person feels individually and socially bound to abide by those legal standards. \n* Policymakers and managers could devise more cist-effective business models so that the perceived benefits of obtaining unauthorized music are reduced, and user-friendly shopping experience for music could be offered to enhance the benefit of “not pirating.”\n|Description of Data=Survey protocol was pretested by a group of faculty members, doctoral students, undergraduate students, and university administration before the actual data collection.

By zooming in on `Greater China', this article presents empirical accounts of specific links and connections on and between the intersecting distribution and piracy networks. In sum, distribution and piracy in China highlight some of the most interesting and intricate insights into issues of power, control, technology, network, speed, global-regional-national dynamics, subjectivities and reflexivity.

However, a very important aspect of the value chain has\nbeen largely ignored-the fact that between creation and consumption, many contracts are likely to be involved, and copyright will, logically, have effects upon the way those contracts are written and interpreted. It is interesting that economists themselves have not put the issue of contracts into the forefront of the economics of copyright, since certainly the study of contracts and the incentives that they create is of primordial interest to economists generally.\n\nThis Article reviews the scant economics literature that does deal with the relationships between the legal institution of copyright and the contracts that are then written along the value chain. It is to be emphasised that this Article only deals with the economic theory literature, and does not consider the legal literature. The principal objective is to clearly identify the research gaps that exist, and to gain some perspective on the question of how these gaps might be prioritised in terms of importance or urgency.\n|Authentic Link=http://heinonline.org.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/intpl18&id=175&collection=journals&index=journals/intpl\n|Reference=Derclaye and Favale (2010); Caves (2000); Kretschmer (2010); Towse (2001); Muthoo (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Main research gaps identified by the study:\n\n*The economic theory profession has not considered in any detail the relationship between the legal institution of copyright and the types of contracts that are written along the value chain for copyrighted goods.\n\n*The topic of contracts has been looked at mainly in terms of royalty contracts, and then only really between creators and intermediaries (e.g., publishers, distributors, etc.)\n\n*An important research gap is to consider exactly how alterations in copyright protection (either some measure of enforcement, or perhaps some measure of scope, or of course the duration of copyright) would affect the terms that would be agreed to via royalty contracts.\n\n*The question of exactly how certain changes in copyright would end up affecting the welfare of the signatories to royalty contracts, thereby altering the balance of revenue flows and incentives, is of great interest.\n\n*Another important research gap would involve the explicit consideration of the perceived "fairness" of copyright contracts to the parties involved, and how (or indeed if) copyright law can be altered so as to ameliorate any perceived\nunfairness. \n\n*It would be useful to consider whether copyright and contracts are always to be understood as complements, or whether they can also maintain a substitute relationship: contracts can work as devices that substitute for copyright law, at\nleast as far as the signatories to the contract are concerned. \n\n*The author suggests we should consider the nature of the substitute-complement relationship between copyright and contracts, and above all, to determine what the nature of the relationship depends upon (with transactions costs being the most logical element). \n\n*The issue of the study of the interrelationship between the contract space and the contracts that are written within it, and copyright law\'s parameters and interpretations, would also be a useful research gap to explore.\n\n*A more careful, methodological, and formal application of the principal-agent framework to the specific case of copyright constitutes the most logical first step forward for economists.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

M. Almost Wikipedia: Eight Early Encyclopedia Projects and the Mechanisms of Collective Action.'''

Several of these attempts built sus- tainable communities of volunteer contributors but none achieved anything near Wikipedia’s success. Why did Wikipedia, superficially similar and a relatively late entrant, attract a commu- nity of millions and build the largest and most comprehensive compendium of human knowl- edge in history? Using data from interviews of these Wikipedia-like projects’ initiators and extensive archival data, I suggest three propositions for why Wikipedia succeeded in mobilizing volunteers where these other projects failed. I also present disconfirming evidence for two im- portant alternative explanations. Synthesizing these results, I suggest that Wikipedia succeeded because its stated goal hewed closely to a widely shared concept of “encyclopedia” familiar to many potential contributors, while innovating around the process and the social organization of production.\n\n\n== Propositions ==\n\n- Wikipedia attracted contributors because it was built around a familiar product.\n\n- Wikipedia attracted contributors because it offered low barriers to contribution.\n\n- Wikipedia attracted contributors because it offered low attribution and low social\nownership of content.\n\n== Method ==\n \n- Multiple [[case study]] Analysis, [[interviews]], digital content analysis\n\n== Discipline ==\n \n- [[Sociology]]\n\n== Data ==\n\n- Interviews and historical records on 8 failed wikipedia projects (founders and users) to interrogate incentives for participation\n\n== Interventions-Response ==\n\n- Welfare can be promoted by flexible legal frameworks that allow the combination of product familiarity and innovative structures of organisation."}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2491, 'title': 'Weatherall, Webster and Bently (2009)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': "{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Weatherall, Webster and Bently (2009)\n|Author=Kimberlee Weatherall; Elizabeth Webster; Lionel Bently\n|Title=IP Enforcement in the UK and Beyond: A Literature Review\n|Year=2009\n|Full Citation=Weatherall, K., Webster, E., & Bently, L.

The paper is not intended to be a full literature survey, but rather attempts to identify the main areas that have been studied, and to offer an overview of what the literature says by means of an analysis of representative publications. The principal objective is to attempt to provide guidance to economists interested in undertaking empirical research on the economics of copyright, particularly in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. I shall attempt to provide an identification of areas for further research and suitable methodological approaches that could be followed by economists, especially in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, to study the economics of copyright empirically. To that end, the paper will address the following general topics: (1) papers dealing specifically with supply side effects (earnings from copyright royalties, the effect of copyright law on creativity, collective management of copyright); (2) papers dealing specifically with demand side effects (willingness to pay by consumers of copyright products, copyright infringement or piracy); (3) papers concerning emerging mechanisms for exercising rights over protected works. The paper concludes with a section that addresses directly the issue of copyright for developing countries.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/economics/1012/wipo_pub_1012.pdf#page=77\n|Link=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/economics/1012/wipo_pub_1012.pdf#page=77\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Liebowitz (1985); Towse (1999); Kretschmer and Hardwick (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Firms tend to employ different appropriability mechanisms. Sometimes they do it sequentially – e.g. an invention is protected by secrecy at a early stage and later on is patented – and at other times simultaneously – e.g. because an invention comprises many elements that can be protected through different appropriability tools.\n* Lead time and secrecy seem to be the most relevant appropriability devices for most sectors and innovation types. Manufacturing and marketing capabilities – an appropriability mechanism which is not always considered in the studies surveyed – also provide a very relevant tool for protecting innovations.\n* Large firms have a higher propensity to patent and they judge patents as a more effective appropriability method than do SMEs. However, this does not necessarily mean that, once they decide to apply for patents, they have more patents than SMEs (since some studies show that larger firms have more patents than patenting SMEs, while others fail to find that result).\n* Although patents are not the most effective method for protecting innovations, many firms employ them anyway, be it jointly with other appropriability methods or not only as a means to protect their innovations but to achieve other objectives – i.e. “strategic patenting” (patent blocking, prevention of suits, reputation enhancing, cross-licensing, attracting venture capital, etc.).\n*  Disclosure and ease of inventing-around are the most important reasons for not patenting.\n* Patents are more relevant as an appropriability mechanism for product than for process innovations and for some sectors such as chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), some machinery industries and biotechnology.\n* SMEs that display aggressive patent strategies often do not have the intention of exploiting their inventions but aim to license or sell them, among other factors, because they lack the production and marketing capabilities (complementary assets) needed for successfully commercializing these inventions.\n* There seem to be “patenting clubs” among manufacturing firms. That is, firms that have more patents and/or perceive patents as an effective appropriability device, tend to have higher patent propensities – in other words, patenting decisions would be related to the firm’s patenting history and its perception of the strength of patents as a protection tool.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

One knows the least about the amount of infringement that occurs and the adoption of informal steps to enforce patents. Statistically sound studies, in the form of representative surveys of firms or inventors, that attempt to quantify the amount and seriousness of infringement are rare internationally, and have not been performed in the UK\n\n* The instances where proceedings are filed have been studied in other countries, but in the UK there does not appear to have been any systematic attempt to collect data on the filing or progress of patent or any other IP cases in the courts.\n\n* Court databases of filed proceedings are not available in a readily searchable form. This contrasts with the situation particularly in the US, where availability of data on patent cases has enabled some interesting research to be done (the same is not true in other areas of IP).\n\n* In relation to the costs of IP litigation, the available data seems to confirm that patent litigation in the UK is more expensive than patent litigation on the continent by a significant degree. The data however is relatively scant, relates only to patents and is based mostly on estimates from a small number of practitioners. No work has been done to ascertain whether costs have changed over recent times with the introduction of the Streamlined Procedure by the Patents Court.\n\n* Quantitative research (on the amount of litigation, and the characteristics of litigation) has yielded interesting results in the US, but may not be possible in the UK unless substantial work is done constructing or making available a database of IP proceedings. Alternatively, there are a range of survey options – surveying individual creators, businesses which use IP, or legal advisors. \n\n* There is plenty of room for research in this area, to get beyond the assertions and anecdotes on which policy tends to be based at present.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 10(06), 1340027.\n|Abstract=This paper investigates the distinctive technology protection strategies of entrepreneurial technology firms. In contrast with much popular opinion, it is reported that intellectual property features more prominently in the business of small entrepreneurial firms than it does in the business of large, established mature firms. The intellectual property portfolios of technology firms of all sizes and ages exhibit a rich array of instruments in addition to patents for protecting technology, including trade secrets, trademarks and copyright, together with licenses to externally sourced technology. The intellectual property profiles of technology firms appear to be influenced by their context, organizational profiles and corporate goals and by the character of their technology.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1630666\n|Reference=Curado and Bontis (2006); Boldrin and Levine (2008); Craig and Moore (2011); Dolfsma (2011);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* It is suggested that the development of an intellectual property strategy for a\ntechnology firm is heavily influenced by the firm’s context, its organizational profile, its\ncorporate goals and the character of its technology; and that this general principle applies\nto small and young firms at least as much as it applies to large and established firms.\n* Thus, the challenges of developing and implementing an intellectual property strategy—\nfor small and young firms as well as large and established firms—mirror those of\ndeveloping an overall business strategy or corporate strategy, in terms of both the\ncomplexity of the challenges and the contingencies that may come in to play.\n* A number of commentators and observers believe that the benefits of intellectual property\naccrue disproportionately to large established firms and that the costs (both direct costs\nand transaction costs) of obtaining intellectual property rights, and of appropriating\nbusiness value from them, work against the interests of small and medium sized\nenterprises. The fact (at least as reported in this paper) that small and medium sized\nenterprises typically invest proportionally more heavily in intellectual property than do\nlarge established firms, suggests that some popular beliefs about this subject are\nmisplaced. The distinctive intellectual property profiles of entrepreneurial technology\nfirms, in contrast with those of the large established firms, may provide clues as to how\nentrepreneurial managers go about crafting strategies to match their difficult\ncircumstances.\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Government or policy=No\n|Literature review=Yes\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset}}{{Dataset}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2005, 'title': 'Willoughby (2013b)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Willoughby (2013b)\n|Author=Willoughby, K.W\n|Title=What impact does intellectual property have on the business performance of technology firms?\n|Year=2013\n|Full Citation=Willoughby, K.

The study found a statistically significant positive relationship between the firms’ investments in intellectual property and their performance. The performance measure was based upon revenue-growth data collected from each firm, and the categories of intellectual property analysed included patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyright and licenses to externally sourced technology. This study also found that the financial benefits of accumulating a strong intellectual property portfolio were enjoyed by technology firms regardless of whether they were strategically oriented towards R&D or strategically oriented towards the commercial production of products and services.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319533\n|Reference=Anuar et al.

(2005); Rogers (2001); Kaimenakis (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In other words, there is statistically significant support for the proposition that the accumulation of IP by technology firms has a positive impact on their financial performance. This broad conclusion applies generally across all types of firms in the sample and to IP ‘in general’\n\n*The nature of the relationship is not uniform across the various types of IP. The positive contributions of IP to financial performance arise predominantly from the firms’ investments in patents, trade secrets and trademarks, rather than from their investment in copyright-protected items or from obtaining licenses to use technology from external sources.\n\n* Here is statistically significant support for the proposition that, insofar as the accumulation of IP by technology firms has a positive impact on their financial performance, the degree of this positive impact will be positively related to the degree to which the firms concentrate their efforts on research and development activities. In short, from the point of view of financial performance, IP appears to matter more for R&D-intensive firms than it does for firms that place less emphasis on research and development.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

It appears necessary for a firm to simultaneously invest in building up an appropriate IP portfolio.\n\n* Second, it is important for managers to artfully employ the right mix of IP rights in support of their technology strategy and business strategy.\n\n*Third, while the cost of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing IP rights can be very high – especially for small, entrepreneurial firms, including start-ups – the research presented here suggests that, on the whole, it is a price worth paying.\n|Description of Data=All of the data utilised for the analyses reported in this paper came from an original empirical study, conducted by the present author, of technology firms in the bioscience-technology industries in the USA. \n\nThe data were generated by administering a detailed structured questionnaire survey to the CEOs of a sample of 184 bioscience-technology firms in the USA during 1997 and 1998.

Journal of Consumer Affairs, 18(2), 317-325.\n|Abstract=Faced with a sharp decline in sales in the early 1980’s, the music industry looked for an explanation which could be converted into windfall gains for itself. The explanation proposed by the industry was increased home taping of pre-recorded music. Through the introduction of federal legislation, the industry hoped to realize gains at the expense of the consumer of home taping equipment and media. The analysis presented here indicates that the independent effect of taping on pre-recorded music sales may not have been as high as the recording industry has claimed, so that consumers may end up paying more than their fair share toward the windfall.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6606.1984.tb00336.x/abstract\n|Reference=Collins (1973); Belinfante and Johnson (1982); James and al. (1983);\n|Plain Text Proposition=It is still possible that a surcharge will be placed on sales of home taping equipment and media, as a follow-on from the aforementioned Mathias Amendment. In effect this would represent a royalty tax placed on consumers. It will be justified by reference to artist and producer copyrights over prerecorded work. While there is some merit in the argument put forth by the owners of copyrights, our worry is that the amount of the surcharge may be derived from crosssectional studies which do not assess the independent impact of economic and demographic change on sales. Our attempt to control for economic and demographic effects on sales of pre-recorded music in recent years through a dynamic economic model indicates that the independent effect of economic and demographic change is much greater than legislators have been led to believe.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

This study obtained college student responses to scenarios that measured perceptions of three types of music theft: shoplifting a CD, illegally downloading, and illegally downloading plus file sharing. The students also reported their own recent downloading behavior, completed a demographics questionnaire, and responded to a series of statements that assessed their attitudes regarding factors associated with legal compliance in other domains. The data indicated that students viewed downloading and file sharing very differently than they viewed shoplifting in terms of endorsement of reasons to comply with laws prohibiting those behaviors. Further, concerns regarding punishment (i.e. deterrence), morality beliefs, and generalized obligation to obey the rule of law had the strongest relationships to self-reported downloading behavior. Respect for the music industry had the weakest relationship to legal compliance with both responses to the scenarios and students’ self-report of their own downloading behavior.\n|Link=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandfonline.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F10683160903179526&ei=B7xjVcCONcGBUfH2gvAK&usg=AFQjCNEPph-Kt_lsQMArSPfw4I-S1_-o3A&sig2=y2qMcl9VDrVxkPcA9MemHg&bvm=bv.93990622,d.d24\n|Reference=Tyler (2006); Gopal, Sanders, Bhattacharjee, Agrawal and Wagner (2004); LaRose and Kim (2007); Levin, Dato-On and Manolis (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=Results:\n* College students endorsed several measured compliance factors more strongly in the case of shoplifting than in the cases of music downloading and sharing.\n* The results of this study suggest that desire to avoid punishment is strongly linked to compliance with music piracy laws.\n* Participants endorsed deterrence motivation less strongly for downloading and sharing than for shoplifting, the construct was still strongly related to self-reported personal downloading frequency.\n* Avoidance of punishment, increased belief that downloading is immoral, and a generalized notion that one should obey the law were strong motivators of decreased downloading frequency\n* There was a significant main effect for the type of music theft between-subjects effects were significant for four of the five compliance factors deterrence, morality, social influence and obligation to obey the law.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Available at SSRN 1478907.\n|Abstract=We examine the relationship between income inequality and piracy rates in the presence of network effects. By the constructions of a theoretical framework, we are able to explain the relationship between income distributions and software piracy rates. Our research suggests that the proportion of the population with positive net benefits from piracy increases with income inequality at a diminishing rate, and then eventually decreases. We provide empirical evidence for this inverted U-shaped relationship between income inequality and piracy rates, while controlling for income, judicial efficiency, and fixed broadband subscribers. Our theoretical and empirical results imply that lax anti-piracy policies would make software producers better off (i.e., higher software sales because of network effects) in countries whose income inequality is moderate, but worse off in countries whose income inequality is severe. Therefore, policies against piracy should be strategically designed considering the non-linear effects of income inequality.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1478907\n|Reference=Husted (2000); Banerjee, et al (2005); Rodriguez (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* National income has a negative and statistically significant effect on piracy rates across eight regression models.

This suggests that preventative policies against piracy need to be strategically established considering the level of income inequality of each nation.\n|Description of Data=Data set included 40 countries from 2003 to 2007 with 106 observations.

In 2003 WIPO published common guidelines on carrying out such research throughout the world. This methodology outlines four groups of copyright industries, identified on the basis of their level of dependence on copyright material. It establishes a set of major indicators – contribution to GDP, employment and foreign trade, and lays out research standards and approaches. The WIPO guidelines were developed on the basis of best international practices by a group of renowned economists. The guidelines have been implemented in over 40 countries around the world and their improvement continues with the experience gained.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/copyright/en/performance/pdf/economic_contribution_analysis_2012.pdf\n|Link=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/copyright/en/performance/pdf/economic_contribution_analysis_2012.pdf\n|Plain Text Proposition=The results of the national surveys confirm the importance of copyright industries in the overall economic performance. Copyright industries are well connected with the rest of the economy and have an active presence in the economic cycle. In many countries, copyright industries are playing a more important role than some traditional industries. Creative industries performance is enhanced when stimulated by governments (economic freedom), the legal system (well established property rights) and the businesses environment (competitiveness,\ninnovation).\n\nNational studies confirm the applicability of the WIPO methodology in countries at various levels of development. Developed countries performance in terms of contribution to GDP is higher in core copyright industries, while the developing countries have higher contribution in the non-core industries. New studies that are being carried out across the world will enhance the analysis and the overview of the performance of the creative industries in the global economy.\n\nMore broadly representative sample to include a greater share of emerging and developed economies will strengthen the robustness of the analysis. The next steps could involve time series analysis, cluster/regional analysis, deeper examination of the relationships through a statistical model that would seek to disclose closer causal relationships between copyright industries performance measures and relevant explanatory variables.\n|FundamentalIssue=4.

The data matrix that has been created enables\nconstant update of the overview of results from country studies and the presentation of the\nvariables surveyed. Currently the data base includes over 60 variables, including data from\nother relevant sources that enhance reporting and analysis on the subject matter.\nThe analysis contained in this document presents an overview of the performance of the\ncopyright industries in selected countries in terms of macroeconomic indicators. It compares\nthis performance with other socio-economic indicators and analyses the structure of this\neconomic contribution, outlining trends and patterns in a comparative perspective. The direct\ndata analysis is followed by a data relationship analysis and a more detailed specific industry\nanalysis. The direct data analysis in this document is based on two major indicators employed to\nmeasure performance of the copyright industries: Contribution to GDP (%) and Share of\nEmployment (%). On the basis of the two a country positioning scheme is established.\n|Data Year=2013\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Data Source=National studies;\n|Method of Collection=Survey Research (quantitative; e.g. sales/income reporting), Quantitative data/text mining, Survey Research (qualitative; e.g. consumer preferences), Document Research\n|Method of Analysis=Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Quantitative content analysis (e.g. text or data mining), Correlation and Association, Textual Content Analysis, Legal Analysis\n|Industry=Publishing of books, periodicals and other publishing; Software publishing (including video games); Film and motion pictures; Television programmes; Sound recording and music publishing; Creative, arts and entertainment;\n|Country=Global;\n|Cross-country=Yes\n|Comparative=Yes\n|Government or policy=Yes\n|Literature review=No\n|Funded By=World Intellectual Property Organization;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=42\n|Level of Aggregation=Country,\n|Data Material Year=2013\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 2313, 'title': 'World Intellectual Property Organization', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{Author}}'}], 'ns': 0}]}

Information Systems Research 23(1):247-259.\n|Abstract=Peer-to-peer sharing networks have seen explosive growth recently. In these networks, sharing files is completely voluntary, and there is no financial reward for users to contribute. However, many users continue to share despite the massive free-riding by others. Using a large-scale data set of individual activities in a peer-to-peer music-sharing network, we seek to understand users’ continued-sharing behavior as a private contribution to a public good. We find that the more benefit users “get from” the network, in the form of downloads, browses, and searches, the more likely they are to continue sharing. Also, the more value users “give to” the network, in the form of downloads by other users and recognition by the network, the more likely they are to continue sharing. Moreover, our findings suggest that, overall, “getting from” is a stronger force for the continued-sharing decision than “giving to.”\n|Authentic Link=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1100.0344\n|Reference=Adar and Huberman (2000); Golle et al.

Similarly, a one standard deviation increase of variables of browse, search, contribute, and been_browsed leads to a 23%, 33%, 32%, and 47% increase in the odds of continued sharing, respectively. Becoming a value use leads to a 146% increase in the odds of continued sharing. \n* Overall, the results show that both self-use and continuous contribution provide strong incentives for users to continue sharing. In addition, “getting-from” is a stronger force for the continued-sharing decision than “giving-to.”\n* Sharing history has a significant effect on users’ decisions to share across all models. The total number of files downloaded has a significantly negative effect on the sharers’ decision to continue sharing. \n* In a PTP network, both the user’s benefits received from the network and the value the user provides to the network are significant predictors of her continued contribution. The level of social interaction and anonymity seems to have little to no effect on whether users continue to share.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Further, showing more statistics to make a user’s use of the network more visible will help the user continue sharing. Finally, adding more features to show how a user’s contribution is used by others have a similar positive effect. \n* Accordingly, recognition in visual representation of users’ contributions to the network can be quite effective in motivating a user’s continued contribution.\n|Description of Data=Researchers logged all activities and commands sent to one of the largest IRC channels (more than 300 million) called #mp3passion, from March 2001 to May 2006. Researchers defined the time window as two weeks for a certain time period.\n\nDuring the entire data collection period, the user size of the sharing channel was stable, with around 20,000 unique users (identifiable by user ID), whereas the number of sharers grew from 600 to more than 2,000. The researchers observed 55,031 unique sharers in total, along with 834,613 free riders. \n\nBecause data were extracted through online activity, information on user demographics was nonobservable.\n|Data Year=May 2001 to May 2006\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Data Source=None;\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Web analytic (online user trace data), Longitudinal Study\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Descriptive statistics (counting; means reporting; cross-tabulation), Multivariate Statistics, Regression Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games); Film and motion pictures; Sound recording and music publishing; Television programmes;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=Not Stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=300,000,000\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual data,\n|Data Material Year=May 2001 to May 2006\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1352, 'title': 'Xia, Duan, Huang and Whinston (2006)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Xia, Duan, Huang and Whinston (2006)\n|Author=Xia, M.; Duan, W.; Huang, Y.; Whinston, A.

Unravel the drivers of online sharing communities: An empirical investigation. Working Paper No. IROM-09-06. Available at SSRN 935004.\n|Abstract=Recently user-oriented online sharing communities have seen explosive growth. Two characteristics of these communities set them apart from traditional online message-based communities such as online forums. First, users have no social ties before joining the community. Second, there is little or no "verbal" communication between users. This research investigates the structure and dynamics of online sharing communities using data collected from an IRC music channel from 2001 to 2006, covering all five years of the post-Napster age. We have collected more than three hundred million individual activities, capturing 0.05% of the global music sharing volume. We find that sharers are an essential part of the community and their activities have a dominant impact on the growth of the community. By contrast, free riders have two opposite impacts on sharer retention. More free riders in number make it more likely for a sharer to keep sharing, while more free rider activities discourage sharers from contributing. That is, the existence of free riders, despite the congestion caused by their download activities, does to some degree stabilize the community. Most previous literature examines the online community only from the aggregate level. Our study, nevertheless, distinguish the influence and behavior of different members in the community. Instead of paying only attention to the total number of users, our results suggest that understanding the impact of their core members is critical in investigating the dynamics and the sustainability of online sharing communities.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=935004; http://www.business.illinois.edu/Working_Papers/papers/06-0109.pdf\n|Reference=Wasko and Faraj (2006); Butler (2001); Krishnan et al. (2003); Jones et al. (2004); Shah (2006);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In non-verbal sharing communities, there are two types of users, sharers and free riders. These two types of users have different roles in the community; sharers are the core part of the community, since the value of a community is in its resource, which is solely provided by sharers.\n* The disproportional network congestion caused by sharers’ own intensive use shows that sharers also contribute to negative network externalities of a community. Moreover, the more sharers are involved in a community, the more likely the sharers continue to contribute content.\n* Fee riders’ are at the exact opposites in retaining sharers; the more free rider download activities, the more likely a sharer will stop sharing. \n* Sharer size is responsible for both sharer gain and loss. The dual effect may be due to the fact that sharer size represents three conflicting community factors: total  resources available, sharer download (their own benefit), and congestion generated by sharers.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

At the same time, the community operator should carefully monitor free riders’ download activities, maybe to go as far as imposing an upper limit to free riders’ download volume or bandwidth, so as to ensure that the sharers’ downloads are smooth and not affected by the often excessive free riders’ traffic. To retain sharers, it is also helpful for the community to provide more features for sharers to interact with other users.\n* For people who need to evaluate non-verbal sharing communities such as investors, they should not only look at the total number of registered users in a community, but also different user types and their often conflicting forces.\n|Description of Data=Large data set of  300 million individual activities in Internet Relay Chat (IRC) sharing channels from March 2001 to May 2006.\n|Data Year=2001-2006\n|Data Type=Primary data\n|Method of Collection=Quantitative Collection Methods, Web analytic (online user trace data), Longitudinal Study\n|Method of Analysis=Quantitative Analysis Methods, Regression Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling\n|Industry=Software publishing (including video games); Sound recording and music publishing;\n|Country=Not stated;\n|Cross-country=No\n|Comparative=No\n|Funded By=Not stated;\n}}\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=300 000 000\n|Level of Aggregation=Individual,\n|Data Material Year=2001-2006\n}}\n}}'}], 'ns': 0}, {'pageid': 1514, 'title': 'Yang, Sonmez, Bosworth and Fryxell (2009)', 'revisions': [{'contentmodel': 'wikitext', 'contentformat': 'text/x-wiki', 'content': '{{MainSource\n|Dataset={{Dataset\n|Sample Size=59\n|Level of Aggregation=Country,\n|Data Material Year=2000-2005\n}}\n|Source={{Source\n|Name of Study=Yang, Sonmez, Bosworth and Fryxell (2009)\n|Author=Yang, D.; Sonmez, M.; Bosworth, D.; Fryxell, G.\n|Title=Global Software Piracy: Searching for Further Explanations\n|Year=2009\n|Full Citation=Yang, D., Sonmez, M., Bosworth, D., & Fryxell, G.

Journal of Business Ethics, 87(2), 269-283.\n|Abstract=This paper identifies that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has a negative effect on software piracy rates in addition to consolidating prior research that economic development and the cultural dimension of individualism also negatively affect piracy rates. Using data for 59 countries from 2000 to 2005, the findings show that economic well-being, individualism and technology development as measured by ICT expenditures explain between 70% and 82% of the variation in software piracy rates during this period. The research results provide important implications for policy makers and business practitioners to help reduce software piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-008-9884-z#page-1\n|Reference=Hofstede (2001); Shin (2004); Banerjee (2003); Banerjee, Khalid, and Sturm (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* The economic well-being, individualism and ICT advancement all appear to significantly influence a nation’s rate of piracy. Their inverse relationships with piracy indicate that the increase of these three can bring down piracy. Consequently, the higher the standard of living, the higher the individualism, and the higher the level of ICT expenditure in an economy, the lower the piracy rate. \n* Because the results were significant and consistent across the six years of the survey, they results are generalizable: ICT has a strong explanatory power to alleviate piracy. Accordingly, increases in ICT have a powerful effect to reducing a country’s piracy rate.\n* This research confirms prior research that income per capita is the most influential factor on software piracy: a one thousand dollar increase in GNI per capita leads to the decrease in the piracy rate from between 0.6 and 1.01 percentage points. This variable alone explains between 59% and 74% of the variations in the rate of piracy across countries. \n* The inclusion of individualism alongside GNI per capita increased the explanatory power of the model by between 4 and 10%: a one unit rise in IDV index results in at least 0.194 percentage point fall in the piracy rate. This confirms previous findings that culture is a complementary factor that impacts software piracy, but perhaps a secondary factor compared to GNI.\n* A one percentage rise in ICT/GNI reduces the incidence of piracy by at least a 1.734 percentage point. The addition of this variable raises the explanatory power of the model by 4% and 6%.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

Thus, economic development amongst the less developed countries will be an important factor in decreasing the demand for pirated goods. \n* Culture is important in handling piracy, and although culture is relatively inherent and deep-rooted in each country, governments can create a culture that recognizes the importance of IP through training and publicity to increase public respect for intellectual creations. \n* Increases in ICT expenditures result in improvements to the quality of ICT infrastructure, raising the demand for legitimate software because of the need for other services supplied with them.\n* Authentic firms can narrow the gap to attract certain groups of consumers through promotional activities and ting their IP with other products and services. These firms should educate consumers about the importance of IP and liase with government to increase public awareness.\n|Description of Data=Piracy rates were compiled from raw data published by the International Planning Research Corporation and commissioned by the BSA.

Theory of Planned Behavior and Ethics Theory in Digital Piracy: An Integrated Model. Journal of Business Ethics, 100, 405-417.\n|Abstract=Since digital piracy has posed a significant threat to the development of the software industry and the growth of the digital media industry, it has, for the last decade, held considerable interest for researchers and practitioners. This article will propose an integrated model that combines the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and ethics theory, the two theories that are most often used in digital piracy studies. Data were obtained from university students in China, and the model was examined using the structural equation model (SEM). The results show that moral obligation and justice, derived from ethics theories and TPB variables, such as attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, influence the behavioral intentions of individuals to commit digital piracy. The attitude of individuals toward digital piracy is also found to be influenced by perceived benefits, perceived risk, and habit.\n|Link=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41475850?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents; http://www.researchgate.net/publication/226746244_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior_and_Ethics_Theory_in_Digital_Piracy_An_Integrated_Model\n|Reference=Cronan and Al-Rafee (2008); Lin et al (1999); Shang, Chen and Chen (2008); D’Astous and Montpetit (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* In the study they create an integrated model that combines the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and ethics theory and empirically tested the model with 10 hypotheses.\n\n* The study finds that moral obligation is the most influential factor on intention to commit digital piracy. \n\n* Perceived behavioral control is a more influential factor in pirating digital materials. It means that individuals who have the skills and resources to pirate digital materials have a higher intention of pirate digital materials. This means that individuals who have the skills and resources to pirate digital materials have a higher intention of pirate digital materials.\n\n* habits were also found to affect attitudes toward digital piracy. This result verifies the fact that the importance of beliefs and actual behavior may vary depending on how long an individual has been pirating software\n\n* In general the attitude of individuals toward digital piracy is also found to be influenced by perceived benefits, perceived risk, and habit.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

The attitude and the perceived behavioral control in the TPB have a great impact on the intention to commit digital piracy. \n* On the other hand, all paths in the H-V model were significant, indicating that a deontological evaluation and a teleological evaluation have a significant impact on ethical judgment, and ethical judgment and teleological evaluation have a significant impact on the intention to commit digital piracy. Therefore, it is desirable that the H-V model be continuously applied and tested as a base model in the IT ethics context.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

It is desirable that companies employ new technologies actively to secure their digital materials to make pirating a much more difficult thing.\n|Description of Data=Data were collected from university students in South Korea.

For an individual producer, the optimal level is (i) no protection, (ii) the\nlevel under which the producer’s overall profit net of the development cost is zero, or (iii)\nfull protection. The optimal level for the society, on the other hand, critically depends on\nthe distribution of firms’ development costs.

In particular, we demonstrate that the optimal level of copyright protection for the underutilization problem is either no protection or full protection, depending on the relative magnitudes of producer’s marginal cost and the non-substitutability of the copy for\nthe original, which in turn affects the marginal cost of copying. For the underproduction problem, we support the claim that an increase in copyright protection will decrease the social welfare loss due to underproduction. The change, however, is not gradual. We show that the social welfare loss due to underproduction is a step function which takes a downward jump to zero at a\nthreshold level of copyright protection.\nIn addition to investigating the common claims, we specify the optimal level of\ncopyright protection for an individual producer and the society as a whole. For an\nindividual producer, the optimal level of copyright protection is: (i) no protection,\n(ii) the level under which the producer’s overall profit net of the development cost\nis zero, or (iii) full protection. We provide conditions under which one of these\nprotection levels is an optimal level.We also discuss the optimal level of copyright\nprotection when there exist many firms, each of which may produce a specific\ncopyrightable product. The optimal level of copyright protection for the society\ncrucially depends on the distribution of firms’ development costs as well as other\nfeatures of the environment.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

I argue that the young viewers’ use of pirated U.S. TV artifacts reflects their active viewership and social agency, defying both the official broadcasting policy in China and the dictates of global copyright industries. Meanwhile, through in-depth interviews with the viewers and a microanalysis of the actual product placement/integration that they encounter, I found that product placement/integration increases the viewers’ awareness of and/or desire for the promoted products/brands. This study bridges the cultural imperialism and active audience theses. Young Chinese viewers are active, yet the extent and the consequences of their activity confirm the critiques that constitute the essence of the cultural imperialism thesis.\n|Authentic Link=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2010.01079.x/full\n|Link=http://www.looooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/j.1753-9137.2010.01079.x1.pdf\n|Reference=Ang (1985); Artz (2003); Zhao (2003); Straubhaar (2007); Xu (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- Audiences’ very real manifestation of agency, or lack thereof, help measure the power of the corporate consumer culture in a particular local context.\n\n- Participants in this study are always active viewers, using pirated materials to overcome the limitations of their location at the lower stratum of the global copyright hierarchy. They make an effort to stay connected to the modern part of the world. They acquire status symbols and cultural capital through watching U.S. TV programs.\n\n- Yet, the commercial nature of these programs, as well as the neoliberal, apolitical discursive surroundings in China, directs their agency toward consumption while disabling an alternative consciousness that could have carried their agency outside of the neoliberal, capitalist confines. In this particular case, the extent of the young viewers’ activity (limited by consumer cultural ideologies) and the consequences of their activity (such as their transformation into active consumers with few counter hegemonic ideas) validate cultural imperialism theorists’ criticisms of the transnational corporate consumer culture and the diminishment of public spheres.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Evidence is found suggesting that IRC has lower maximal social welfare than FLC does. This difference can be explained by the way copyright duration is determined. Copyright duration represents the balance between encouraging creation and reducing restrictions on the consumption of information products. Under FLC, copyright duration is chosen directly by legislation; under IRC, it is induced indirectly through a copyright fee. However, the imposition of a copyright fee distorts the behavior of creators and thus decreases social welfare.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10438590500284493#.Vw5226QrLIU\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (2003); Besen and Kirby (1989);\n|Plain Text Proposition=This study models the market of information products under FLC and under IRC.

However, if both FLC and IRC can be configured\noptimally, then IRC reduces social welfare. It is suggested that IRC is the third-best solution\nand FLC is the second-best solution to the problem of high creative cost and low reproduction\ncost of information products. Under FLC, copyright length is set directly to balance the needs\nof encouraging creation and reducing restrictions on consumption.

Journal of Law and Economics, 49(1), 63-90.\n|Abstract=File sharing may substantially undermine the intellectual property rights of digital goods. This paper concentrates on the music industry. I estimate the effect of music downloads on the probability of purchasing music using a European individual-level\ncross section of 15,000 people from 2001. A simple comparison of means shows that people who regularly download music online are more likely to buy music. The positive relationship persists when controlling for observed characteristics. However, simultaneity between tastes for music and peer-to-peer usage makes it difficult to isolate the causal effect of music downloads on music purchases. To break that simultaneity, this paper uses measures of Internet sophistication and the speed of the Internet connection as instruments. The results suggest that peer-to-peer usage reduces the probability of buying music by 30 percent. On the basis of my estimates, back of the-envelope calculations indicate that-without downloads-sales in 2002 would have been around 7.8 percent higher.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/501082?uid=2129&uid=2134&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21106874756863\n|Reference=Liebowitz (2003); Rob and Waldfogel (2004); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2004); Zentner (2005);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main findings of this paper are:\n\n* This paper uses a European individual‐level database to measure the impact of online music file-sharing may explain a 30 percent reduction in the probability of buying music.\n\n* If music downloading reduces the probability of buying by 30 percent, if 15 percent of the population downloads music, if downloaders are twice as likely to buy music than nondownloaders, and if—conditional on buying—downloaders and nondownloaders buy the same quantity of units, then sales in 2002 would have been 7.8 percent  higher.\n\n* Downloaded music may be shared with people who do not download MP3 files and affect their purchases as well. In this event, the estimates understate the effect of online music downloading on music sales.\n\n* The interest is not exclusive to the music industry.

This article presents a content analysis of articles from the five highest circulating U.S. newspapers 1989–2004 as evidence of the prevailing social environment surrounding software piracy. The rationales in the news articles are analyzed as evidence of the social and psychological underpinnings of attitudes toward software piracy. An expanded version of Sykes and Matza’s (American Sociological Review 22, 664–670, 1957); Zamoon and Curley (Working paper, Kuwait University, Kuwait, 2007) neutralization framework is applied to analyze the content of the articles. We found that rationales condoning piracy showed a more balanced use of neutralization approaches, and less moral intensity toward the behavior. In contrast, rationales condemning piracy mostly promoted the injury aspect of software piracy, and suggested higher moral intensity. The discrepancies have practical implica- tions as a barrier to the ability to connect the two sides of the debate concerning software piracy.\n|Authentic Link=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-007-9636-5\n|Link=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/23534558_Ripped_from_the_Headlines_What_can_the_Popular_Press_Teach_us_about_Software_Piracy\n|Reference=Sykes and Matza (1957); Takeyama (1994); Sundararajan (2004); Zamoon and Curley (2007);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main results of the study are:\n\n*Excluding the editorials (which were infrequent), the distribution of rationales (pro vs. anti piracy) significantly differed depending on article type (v2(1) = 5.65, p = 0.018). News reports tended to have more anti-piracy arguments (151/278 of the rationales in reports) and news columns tended to present more pro-piracy arguments (115/203 of the rationales in columns). \n\n*Most of this asymmetry arose from the presence of monetary rationales. \n\n*Out of the 192 articles coded, 122 gave rationales for piracy and they included 252 rationales. These rationales were an accumulation of statements from pirates, prosecutors, and reporters’ commentaries on piracy issues. The three leading reason categories for condoning piracy were reducing monetary expenditures, justifications based on features of piracy processes, and deficiencies in law enforcement, each accounting for 43/252 (17.1%) of the cited rationales. \n\n*Of the 192 articles coded, 156 gave rationales against piracy providing 248 rationales. The leading reason category, capturing 132/249 (53.2%) of the citations, was the economic hardships that piracy causes for software producers. This general pattern, of greater unanimity among rationales against piracy compared to those favoring piracy, will arise again in subsequent analyses.\n\n*The data reveal a disjoint in the public conversation surrounding software piracy, where pro-piracy and anti-piracy rationales tend to approach the issue from differing perspectives.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

File sharing technology would undoubtedly be welfare-improving provided that it did not displace music sales. Yet music purchases have decayed sharply since the introduction of file sharing a decade ago. This paper seeks to measure the effect of peer-to-peer file sharing on music sales. I use a long panel of twelve years of country-level data containing information on both physical and digital music sales and on Internet and broadband penetration. This database includes not only information going back to a period when peer-to-peer downloading did not exist, but also includes more recent information up to 2008. I employ Internet connectedness and the speed of Internet connections as proxies for unauthorized downloading, and study whether physical and total country-level music purchases have decayed more rapidly in countries experiencing faster increases in the adoption of file swapping technology. This paper uses the increase in broadband penetration replacing dial-up in order to isolate the effect of file sharing from any other possible Internet impact on music sales. My results indicate that peer-to-peer file-sharing can explain a reduction in music sales that ranges from half of the actual decrease in sales up to the entire decrease.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1724444\n|Reference=Blackburn (2004); Zentner (2005); Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007); Liebowitz (2008);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The main findings of this paper are: \n\n* Unauthorized downloading has reduced the market value of copyrighted musical works by economically large magnitudes.\n\n* The findings indicate that unauthorized downloading can explain a substantial reduction in sales, ranging from approximately half of the actual reduction in sales up to the entire observed reduction.\n\n* Peer-to-peer downloading has similar impacts on both total (combining physical sales and legal music downloads) and on physical music sales alone.\n\n* The speed of the Internet connections is an important determinant in explaining the actual decay in music sales.\n\n* The extent to which the reduction in the copyright value results in diminished artistic and cultural creations is yet to be known.\n|FundamentalIssue=5.

Available at SSRN 1792615\n|Abstract=The music industry has struggled during the past decade due to file sharing and movie business executives fear the same fate. This paper seeks to provide measurements of the effects of peer-to-peer file sharing on the movie industry. We use a long panel of data at the country level containing information on theatrical, video rental, and video retail movie commercial performances, as well as Internet and broadband penetration. We compare the impacts of increased high-speed online connectedness replacing slow-speed Internet connectedness before and after the introduction of the second-generation file sharing technology that has made movie file sharing feasible. This empirical strategy allows us to isolate the effects of file sharing from any other possible Internet impacts on the commercial performance of movies unrelated to file sharing. Our results indicate that the effect of peer-to-peer file sharing is negative and large on video sales, but we do not have confidence regarding the impacts of file sharing on either the theatrical commercial performance of movies or video rentals.\n|Link=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1792615\n|Reference=Boutin (2004); Bounie, Bourreau and Waelbroeck (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2006); Rob and Waldfogel (2007); Zentner (2009);\n|Plain Text Proposition=- The study’s results indicate that in the absence of file sharing global video sales would have experienced an increase larger than that observed. The authors therefore provide some evidence that appears to substantiate the concerns of movie studios regarding file sharing's potential for diminishing their revenues.\n\n- However, this research does not find conclusive results for the file sharing effect on either the theatrical or video rental commercial performance of movies. The authors provide various reasons that seem to indicate that movie file sharing should be expected to displace video consumption to a greater extent than theatrical attendance (e.g. movie files on peer-to peer networks are usually of a better quality after the official release of the DVD than before this time).\n\n- The authors also argue that they would expect the effect of file sharing on video sales to be larger than the effect on rentals (consumers will be more inclined to either download or buy movies they plan to watch several times than movies they plan to watch only once). These factors might explain their finding that file sharing only affects video sales.\n|FundamentalIssue=1.

I examine the impact of digital rights management (DRM) - a prevalent strategy used by firms in media industries to address piracy concerns - on music sales. I exploit a natural experiment, where different labels remove DRM from their entire catalogue of music at different times, to examine whether relaxing an album\'s sharing restrictions increases sales. Using a large sample of albums from all four major record labels, I find that removing DRM increases digital music sales by 10% but relaxing sharing restrictions does not impact all albums equally. It increases the sales of lower-selling albums (i.e., the "long tail") significantly (30%) but does not benefit top-selling albums. These results suggest that the optimal strength of copyright depends on the distribution of products in firms\' portfolio.\n|Link=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2515581\n|Reference=Anderson (2006); Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Simester (2011); Peitz and Waelbroeck (2006); (Schumpeter, 1934);\n|Plain Text Proposition=* Removing DRM increases record sales by 10% and increases sales more in the long tail of the distribution, meaning that less well known artists gain the most from removing DRM. \n* This suggests that lowering search costs facilitates discovery and thus increases album sales.

Journal of Management Information Systems 25.1 (2008): 199-232.\n|Abstract=The availability of data on the Web and new data extraction technologies have made it increasingly easy to reuse existing data to create new databases and provide value-added services. Meanwhile, database creators have been seeking legal protection for their data, such as the European Union's Database Directive. The legislative development shows that there is significant difficulty in finding the right balance between protecting the incentives of creating publicly accessible databases (including semistructured Web sites) and preserving adequate access to factual data for value-creating activities. We address this issue using an extended spatial competition model that explicitly considers licensing provisions and inefficiencies in policy administration. The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, there are different socially beneficial policy choices, such as protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding. With the appropriate policy in place, both the creators and the reusers should focus on innovation that can increase the variety of databases and create value from database contents.\n|Authentic Link=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222250108#.Vwl17aQrLIU\n|Reference=Landes and Posner (1989); Lessig (1998);\n|Plain Text Proposition=The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, there are different socially beneficial policy choices, such as protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding.

One of the important factors to consider in policy formulation is the financial interests in database contents. A creator who invested in creating a database is interested in recouping the investment using the revenues that the database helps to generate. The revenues may be reduced when a free-riding reuser creates a competing database by extracting the contents from the creator's database. Thus, creators would like to have certain means of protecting the contents in their databases. Without adequate protection, the incentives of creating  such databases could diminish. On the other hand, overprotection can cause under-utilization of information and make downstream value-added data reuse costly or even impossible. It is important, and often rather difficult, to formulate a policy that reasonably balances the two interests.\n|Description of Data=This study analyses different models of database creation with various levels of openness and protection, using information from previous empirical studies published from 1989 to 2008.
